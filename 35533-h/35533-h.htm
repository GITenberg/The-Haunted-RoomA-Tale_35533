<h2>Preface.</h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="I" class="cap" />
<p class="cap08">It is under peculiar circumstances that
A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;E. sends forth this little volume.
As it is passing through the
press its author is preparing to enter on a new
field of labour in the East, as an honorary member
of the Zenana Mission in India. Of the fact that
the missionary cause has been dear to A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;E.
her readers may be aware from her former writings.
She now hopes to be permitted to devote an evening
hour of her life to that cause. India is endeared to
her from family associations; for there a revered
father, and subsequently his sons, lived and laboured,
and in that land rests the dust of dear ones
who sleep in Jesus.</p></div>

<p>If there be, as she fain would hope, something of
a tie between a writer and those familiar with her
works, may not A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;O.&nbsp;E. venture to claim an<span class="pagenum">[vi]</span>
interest in the prayers of her readers? May she
not hope that they will ask for her, wisdom, humility,
zeal, and success? It would be sweet to one
struggling with the difficulty of learning a new
language to know that many joined in the supplication,
&ldquo;O Lord! open Thou her lips, that her mouth
may shew forth Thy praise!&rdquo; and that many besought
Him whose strength is made perfect in
weakness, to enable His servant to win Indian gems
to lay at His feet.</p>

<h1>THE HAUNTED ROOM.</h1>



<hr class="l2"/>
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>A PLEASANT HOME.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_a1.jpg" width="100" height="87" alt="&quot;A" class="cap" />
<p class="cap17">&ldquo;A pleasant nest my brother-in-law has
found for his family,&rdquo; said Captain
Arrows to himself, as, carpet-bag in
hand, he walked the brief distance from a railway-station
to his relative&rsquo;s house. &ldquo;Trevor&rsquo;s home is
near enough to London for its inmates to reach
Charing-Cross by train in fifteen minutes, and
yet far enough from it to be beyond reach of its
smoke and noise. Not quite so,&rdquo; added the captain
as he passed a Savoyard with hurdy-gurdy and
monkey, and then was overtaken by an omnibus
well filled within and without; &ldquo;but I doubt if
our young folk would have relished perfect rural
seclusion, or would have wished to have dwelt fifty
miles from the Great Exhibition and Albert Hall.<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
As long as he holds his government office, Trevor
cannot live far from London; and in choosing his
residence here, he has made a pleasant compromise
between town and country. This is as bright-looking
a home as heart could wish,&rdquo; thought the
captain, as from the slope of a hill he came in sight
of a pretty villa, in the Elizabethan style, standing
in its own grounds. &ldquo;These gay flower-beds, with
their geometrical shapes and blooming flowers, show
the ingenuity of Bruce and the taste of Emmie.
The croquet loops on the lawn, the target in the
little field yonder, tell of lives passed in ease and
enjoyment. It may be a question whether such
lives be indeed the most desirable for our young
men and maidens,&rdquo; thus the captain pursued his
reflections as he walked down the hill. &ldquo;Simply
to pass youth as pleasantly as possible seems to
be hardly the best preparation for the rough campaign
of existence. We would not train our army
recruits in Arcadia. It would be an interesting
problem, had we the means of working it out,
to find out how far our characters are formed by
our surroundings, as physical qualities are affected
by climate. Would early acquaintance with
difficulties and dangers ever have braced up our
lovely Emmie into a heroine, or made Vibert a
reflective and self-denying man? As for Bruce, he<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
has in him so much of the nature of the oak sapling,
that the most enervating air could not rob him of
all the knots and toughness of close-grained wood.
Another curious problem to solve would be, how far
easy, luxurious existence in youth is actually conducive
to happiness; whether the prospect from a
bleak hill-side be not fairer, as well as its air more
bracing, than that of the garden of the Hesperides.
Where the mind has no real difficulties with which
to grapple, the imagination is wont to grow with
the rank luxuriance of tropical vegetation. Nervousness,
superstition, anxiety about trifles, take the
place of serious trials; and the child of luxury, to
parody the fine line of Johnson,</p></div>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Makes the misery he does not find.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The captain had no more leisure for his reflections,
for, as he threw open the gate of Summer Villa,
his approach was seen from the house, and two of
its inmates hastened forth to meet a favourite uncle.
A graceful maiden ran lightly down the shrubbery
path, followed by her younger brother, a handsome
lad of some sixteen or seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are so welcome; we were so glad to
get your telegram and know that your long cruise
was over!&rdquo; cried Emmie as she gave to her mother&rsquo;s
brother an affectionate greeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve so much to tell you, captain,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
Vibert Trevor, cordially shaking the hand of the
newly-arrived guest. &ldquo;John is away, so let me
carry your carpet-bag into the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, from Vibert, was rather a remarkable offer
of service. The captain accepted it with a smile,
for Vibert was little accustomed to act the part of a
porter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Bruce?&rdquo; asked Arrows. &ldquo;As for
your father, I suppose that he is at his office in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; papa is not at his office,&rdquo; replied Emmie,
slipping her arm into that of her uncle. &ldquo;But
come into the house and have refreshment, and
while you take it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you the whole story,&rdquo; cried Vibert,
looking like one who has a grand piece of news to
impart.</p>

<p>While the three enter Summer Villa, let us pause
and glance at them for a few moments.</p>

<p>Captain Arrows is a naval officer. He has
scarcely reached middle age, and looks young to be
addressed as &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; by the young lady who rests
on his arm, or the tall brother at her side. The
captain&rsquo;s face, bronzed by sun and wind, is not one
to be easily forgotten, so keen and piercing are the
dark eyes which glance from beneath projecting
brows. An expression of satire sometimes plays<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
around the thin lips, but of satire tempered and
controlled. The impression conveyed by Arrows&rsquo;
appearance and manner would be, &ldquo;That is a man
of character, a man of decision, a keen observer,
who looks as if he were making notes for a book
satirizing the follies of mankind.&rdquo; But there is a
kindly frankness about the sailor which tends to
counteract the sense of restraint which might otherwise
be felt in his society. If he carry the sharp
rapier of wit at his side, it is sheathed in the scabbard
of good-nature.</p>

<p>Never does Arrows look more kindly or soften
his tone to more gentleness than when addressing
the motherless daughter of a sister loved and
mourned. Emmie is, indeed, one to draw out the
affections of those around her. Not only is her face
fair, but it has the sweetness of expression which is
more winsome than beauty. Her soft dark-brown
hair does not, in the shapeless masses prescribed by
modern fashion, mar the classical contour of a gracefully
formed head. Gentle, tender, and clinging,
the maiden&rsquo;s type might be found in the fragrant
white jasmine that embowers the porch of her
pleasant home. Emmie&rsquo;s school companions have
loved her; not one of them could remember a harsh
or unkind word spoken by the lips of the gentle
girl. Her brothers love her; Emmie has shared<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
their interests, and joined them in their amusements,
without ever brushing away that feminine softness
which, as the down to the peach, is to woman one
of the greatest of charms. Bruce would have disliked
having &ldquo;a fast girl&rdquo; for his sister almost as
much as Mr. Trevor would have disapproved of his
daughter earning that title. The slang in which
some modern ladies (?) indulge would have sounded
from the lips of Emmie as startling as the blare
of a child&rsquo;s trumpet toy breaking in on a melody
of Beethoven.</p>

<p>Vibert Trevor in appearance resembles his sister;
but what is pleasingly feminine in the woman looks
somewhat effeminate in the boy. Boy! how could
the word escape my pen! Vibert, in his own
estimation at least, has left boyhood long ago. His
auburn hair, parted carefully down the middle, falls
on either side of a face which would be singularly
handsome but for the somewhat too great fulness
about the mouth. The lad is dressed fashionably
and in good taste. If there be a little tinge of
foppishness in his appearance, it is as slight as the
scent which a superfine cigar has left on his clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more refreshment for me, thanks; I have
taken some in London,&rdquo; said the captain in reply to
a question from his niece as they entered the house
together.<span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we will go into the drawing-room,&rdquo; said
Emmie. &ldquo;We expect papa and Bruce by the next
train from Wiltshire. Papa wrote that they would
reach this an hour before dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cheerful drawing-room was that which looked
out on the lawn of Summer Villa, lighted up as it
was by the rich glow of a September sun, then just
at its setting. The red light sparkled on the crystal
globe in which gold-fish were gliding, and lent
vividness to the green of the graceful ferns which
ornamented both the windows. Emmie&rsquo;s piano was
open, with a piece of music upon it. Emmie was
an enthusiast in music. She had to displace her
guitar from the sofa on which she had left it, to
make room for her uncle to sit by her side. Emmie&rsquo;s
basket with its fancy work lay on the table, and
traces of her late employment in the shape of dropped
beads and morsels of bright German wool strewed
the soft carpet. Emmie rather felt than saw that
her uncle&rsquo;s eye detected the little untidiness; the
naval officer was himself &ldquo;so dreadfully neat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for your news,&rdquo; said the captain, as he
seated himself by his niece, while Vibert threw
himself into an arm-chair. Vibert usually chose,
as if by instinct, the most luxurious chair in the
room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you say if papa were to throw up<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
office, leave Summer Villa for ever and for aye, and
carry us all off to be buried alive?&rdquo; cried Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Labrador&mdash;or equatorial Africa?&rdquo; inquired
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so bad as either of those distant
deserts,&rdquo; laughed Vibert. &ldquo;Myst Hall is not a
hundred miles from London, and Wiltshire is not
quite beyond the pale of civilized life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened to make such a migration
probable?&rdquo; inquired Arrows. &ldquo;You know that
during our northern cruise I have had no letters,
and that as regards home news, the last three months
have been to me an absolute blank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our story is easily told,&rdquo; said Emmie. &ldquo;You
will, I dare say, remember that papa had an aunt,
Mrs. Myers, who lived in Wiltshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I recollect the name, but little besides,&rdquo; replied
Arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of us knew much of Aunt Myers,&rdquo; continued
his niece. &ldquo;Except a hamper of home-made
preserves which came to us from Myst Court every
Christmas, we had little to remind us of a relative
who shut herself up from her family and friends for
fifty long years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if we forgot the old dame, she did not
forget us,&rdquo; interrupted Vibert. &ldquo;Aunt Myers died
eight or nine days ago and there came a letter from<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
her lawyer announcing her death, and informing my
father that he is the old lady&rsquo;s heir, executor, and
the master of Myst Court, with all the fields,
pleasure-grounds, cottages, copses, and I don&rsquo;t know
what else thereto appertaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain did not look as much impressed by
the announcement as his young informant expected
that he would be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa, of course, went to his poor aunt&rsquo;s funeral,&rdquo;
said Emmie, &ldquo;and took Bruce with him to see what
he thought of the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was plenty of business to be transacted,&rdquo;
observed Vibert; &ldquo;I fancy that there always is
when landed property changes hands. My father
asked for a week&rsquo;s holiday from office-work. Perhaps
he will give up his appointment altogether;
all depends on whether he decide to live on his own
estate, or to let it and take a new lease of Summer
Villa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have had letters from your father; to
which decision does he appear to incline?&rdquo; asked
the captain, addressing himself to his niece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa has been very busy, and wrote but briefly,&rdquo;
said Emmie. &ldquo;I believe that a good deal will
depend on whether papa is satisfied with what he
sees of a gentleman at S&mdash;&mdash;, who has been highly
recommended as a private tutor for my brothers.<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
S&mdash;&mdash; is but three miles from Myst Court, so that
if we lived at that place, Vibert and Bruce could go
over to Mr. Blair&rsquo;s for study every week-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s plan, now that Bruce and I have
left Cheltenham,&rdquo; interrupted Vibert, &ldquo;is to keep
us with him at home for a year or two, and have
us prepared for Cambridge or some competitive
examination by a private tutor, either in London,
or at S&mdash;&mdash;, if we go into Wiltshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What description does Bruce give of Myst
Court?&rdquo; inquired Captain Arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce is a lazy dog with his pen, and seldom
honours me with a scratch of it,&rdquo; answered Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce wrote to me the day after he went into
Wiltshire,&rdquo; said Emmie. &ldquo;He knew that I should
be interested to hear of the place which may soon
be our home. Bruce writes that the house is of the
date of the reign of Queen Anne; that it is built of
red brick, and looks rather formal, but has splendid
trees around it. Myst Court stands quite by itself,
with no other country-house near it, and has the
reputation of being <i>haunted</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arrows smiled at the gravity with which the
young lady pronounced the last word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myst Court must be a horridly dull place, at
least for those who are not sportsmen!&rdquo; cried
Vibert. &ldquo;Bruce and I may find a little liveliness<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
at S&mdash;&mdash;; but for you, Emmie, it will be a case
of&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;And still she cried, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very dreary&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&rsquo;Tis dreary and sad,&rdquo; she said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, &ldquo;I am aweary, aweary;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wish I were dead!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Emmie laughed, but the laugh was rather a
forced one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister will never, I hope, echo the peevish
complaint of an idle girl, who had not energy enough
to nail up her peaches,&rdquo; observed Captain Arrows.
&ldquo;If Emmie go to Wiltshire, it will be, I trust, to
lead there an active, useful, and happy life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder on what course papa will decide,&rdquo;
said Emmie; &ldquo;we are very anxious to know. A
great deal will depend on what Bruce thinks desirable,&mdash;papa
has such an opinion of the judgment
of Bruce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce has a precious good opinion of his own,&rdquo;
said Vibert, with something like scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame!&mdash;how can you!&rdquo; cried Emmie, in a
tone of playful reproof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are! here come my father and Bruce!&rdquo;
cried Vibert, rising from his easy-chair as he caught
sight of two figures at the gate.</p>

<p>Emmie had started up, and was out of the room
to receive the travellers, before Vibert had finished
the sentence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>COMING TO A DECISION.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_y1.jpg" width="100" height="86" alt="&quot;Y" class="cap" />
<p class="cap15">&ldquo;Yes, I am satisfied in regard to educational
advantages for my sons,&rdquo; said Mr.
Trevor, in reply to a question asked
by the captain, when, a few minutes afterwards,
the family were gathered together in the drawing-room.
&ldquo;The tutor, Mr. Blair, appears to be in
every way qualified to do full justice to his pupils;
I had a very satisfactory interview with him at
S&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;But Myst Court itself, what do you think of
the place?&rdquo; inquired Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house was originally handsome, but it is
now utterly out of repair,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose that painter or glazier has
entered the door for these last fifty years,&rdquo; observed
Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grounds are extensive,&rdquo; continued Mr.
Trevor; &ldquo;but the trees are choking each other for<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
lack of thinning; and the brushwood, through
neglect, has thickened into a jungle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good cover for rabbits and hares,&rdquo; observed
Vibert, who had an eye to sport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never before saw such wretched cottages,&rdquo;
said Bruce; &ldquo;and there are sixty-one of them on
the estate, besides two farms. The hovels are dotted
in groups of threes and fours in every corner
where one would not expect to find them. Some
lean forward, as if bending under the weight of
their roofs; some to one side, as if trying to get
away from their neighbours; some cottages look as
if they were tired of standing at all. I cannot
imagine how the men and women, and swarms of
bare-footed children, manage to live in such dirty
dens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no one to look after the people?&rdquo; asked
Captain Arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no church or school-house nearer than
S&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; replied Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;The people either
work for the neighbouring farmers, or in a dyeing
factory which stands about a mile from Myst Court.
Wages are low in that part of the country; but
that is not sufficient to account for the misery which
we saw there. Ignorance prevails&mdash;ignorance more
dense than I could have believed to have been found
in any part of our favoured land. I doubt whether<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
of the peasants one in four is able even to read.
As a matter of course, drunkenness and every other
vice spread as weeds over a field so neglected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is there that the labourer is called to lay his
hand to the plough,&rdquo; observed Captain Arrows.</p>

<p>Vibert gave an almost imperceptible shrug of his
shoulders; Bruce as slight an inclination of his
head. A very faint sigh escaped from the lips of
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been giving the matter serious, very
serious thought,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;My first idea,
when I found that my aunt had bequeathed the
property to me, was to let Myst Court, and to remain
at least for some years in Summer Villa, where
we have been for long so comfortably settled. But
I found, on visiting Myst Court, that it would be
impossible to let the house without effecting such
extensive and thorough repairs as I could not at
present undertake. Even if this were not so&mdash;&rdquo;
Mr. Trevor paused, as if to reflect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No mere tenant could be expected to take the
same interest in the people as would be felt by you,
their landlord and natural protector,&rdquo; observed the
captain, concluding the sentence which his brother-in-law
had left unfinished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you think that we are bound to act as
props to the cottages that are leaning forwards or<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
sideways, and make them hold themselves straight,
as respectable cottages ought to do!&rdquo; laughed Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what have you to say about the haunted
room?&rdquo; timidly inquired Emmie, who had been
sitting with her hand in that of her father, a hitherto
silent but much interested listener to the conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haunted! Oh, that&rsquo;s all nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bruce. &ldquo;Myst Court is no more haunted than is
Summer Villa; it is simply a big, dreary-looking
house that wants new mortar on its walls, new glass
to replace what is cracked in its windows, and a
good fairy, in the shape of a young lady, to turn it
into a cheerful, comfortable home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What gives to Myst Court the name of being
haunted,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;is simply this. My aunt,
who was of a nervous and highly sensitive nature, had
the misfortune to lose her husband, a short time after
their marriage, in a very distressing way. When on
his wedding-tour, Mr. Myers was bitten by a mad
dog, and a few weeks after bringing his bride to
their home he died of hydrophobia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very dreadful indeed,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;The
shock of witnessing Mr. Myers&rsquo; sufferings (he died in
frantic delirium) almost upset the reason of his unfortunate
wife. She fell into a state of morbid melancholy,
making an idol of her grief. From the day<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
of her husband&rsquo;s funeral to that of her own death, a
period of fifty years, my poor aunt never once
quitted the house, even to attend a place of worship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most singular and eccentric mark of the
widow&rsquo;s sorrow was her determination that the
room in which her husband died should always remain
as it was on the day of his burial,&rdquo; said Bruce.
&ldquo;Aunt Myers had the shutters closed, and the door
not only locked, but actually bricked up, so that no
foot might ever enter or eye look on the apartment
connected in her mind with associations so painful.
It is merely that closed-up chamber which gives to
the house the name of being haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sooner it is opened to heaven&rsquo;s light and
air the better,&rdquo; observed Captain Arrows. &ldquo;Let the
first thing done in that house be to unbrick and unlock
the door, fling back shutters and throw open
windows, and the first time that I visit Myst Court
let me sleep in the haunted chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that I have not the power either to
follow your advice or to gratify your wish,&rdquo; said Mr.
Trevor. &ldquo;My poor aunt, retaining her strange
fancy to the last, actually&mdash;in a codicil to her will&mdash;made
as a condition to my possession of the place
that the room in which her husband died should remain
as it is now, bricked up and unused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That condition would add not a little to the<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
difficulty of letting or selling the house,&rdquo; observed
the practical Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears to be a law of nature that whatever
is useless becomes actually noxious,&rdquo; remarked the
captain. &ldquo;That closed chamber, into which the
sun never shines, will tend to make the dwelling
less healthy, as well as less cheerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Emmie breathed a faint sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now we return to my proposition,&rdquo; said
Mr. Trevor gravely. &ldquo;Shall I remain where I am,
and put this large property into the hands of some
agent to let or improve as he may,&mdash;with but little
chance of its becoming of much more than nominal
value; or shall I give up my office, take the pension
to which I am now entitled, live on my own estate,
look after my tenants, and gradually effect such improvements
as may make the land profitable, if not
to myself, to my heirs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does Bruce, who has seen the property,
say on the question?&rdquo; asked the captain, turning
towards his elder nephew.</p>

<p>Bruce replied alike without haste or hesitation.
&ldquo;If my father leave his office in London, there are at
least twenty persons ready and eager to fill his place,
and to do his work; but there is not one who could
be his substitute at Myst Court. It is the master&rsquo;s
eye that is wanted there, not that of a paid agent.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>

<p>Young as was Bruce, his words carried weight
with his father. Mr. Trevor&rsquo;s elder son in most
points presented a contrast to Vibert; as regarded
ripeness of judgment, the fifteen months that separated
their ages might have been as many years. In
physical appearance the brothers were also unlike
each other. Bruce, though older, was not so tall as
Vibert; his frame was spare and slight. He had
not, like Emmie and his brother, inherited their
mother&rsquo;s beauty. The good sense expressed in his
steady gray eyes, the decision marked in the curve
of his lip, alone redeemed the countenance of Bruce
from being of a commonplace type. The characteristics
of the three Trevors had been thus playfully
sketched by a lively girl who was a frequent guest
at Summer Villa: &ldquo;If I want amusement, I choose
Vibert for my companion; if I need sympathy, I
turn to Emmie; but if I am in difficulty or danger,
commend me to Bruce, he has the cool brain and
firm heart. I like Vibert; I love Emmie; but
Bruce is the one whom I trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A brief silence succeeded the young man&rsquo;s reply
to his father; it was broken by Vibert&rsquo;s inquiry,
&ldquo;What sort of a town is S&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like any other county town,&rdquo; replied Bruce
shortly. The question seemed to him to be trifling,
and irrelevant to the subject of conversation.<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;S&mdash;&mdash; seemed to me to be a pleasant, cheerful
place,&rdquo; said the more indulgent father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose that fishing and shooting are to
be had at Myst Court?&rdquo; inquired the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A stream runs through part of the property, and
there is likely to be plenty of game in the copse,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I vote that we go to Myst Court!&rdquo; cried
Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing which makes me hesitate in
coming to a decision,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevor, &ldquo;is the
doubt as to whether my dear girl would like being
taken from her present bright home. Emmie has
here so many sources of innocent amusement, so
many young friends and pleasant companions, that
it might be trying for her to be transplanted to a
place which I cannot now represent as a cheerful
abode, though I hope that it in time may become
such.&rdquo; Mr. Trevor, as he spoke, looked tenderly on
his daughter, and pressed the hand which he held in
his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, papa, do not think about me; I shall have
you and my brothers,&rdquo; said Emmie. It did not
escape the notice of Arrows that his niece spoke with
a little effort, and that her lip quivered as she uttered
the words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have a pony-chaise, too,&rdquo; said her<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
father; &ldquo;it will be needed to carry you to church
on Sundays, and on week-days you shall drive about
the country, explore the neighbourhood, or indulge
a lady&rsquo;s taste by shopping in S&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And carry us back from our tutor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; interrupted
Vibert; &ldquo;for I suppose that a hansom is not to be
got for love or money; and I&rsquo;ve no fancy for trudging
six miles every day, like a horse in a mill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time that the dressing-bell rang before
dinner, the question of removing to Wiltshire was
virtually settled. Emmie was too unselfish and
high-principled to oppose a decision which approved
itself both to her common sense and her conscience.
She tried to hide from her father her strong repugnance
to leaving Summer Villa, its pleasant associations
and friendly society, in order to bury herself
alive in a grand, gloomy house, quite out of repair,
and with the name of being haunted besides.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>GOSSIP DOWNSTAIRS.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The topic which excited such interest in
the drawing-room was certain to be
eagerly discussed in the kitchen also.
At the servants&rsquo; supper-table that night nothing
was talked about but Myst Hall, and the probability
of the Trevor family leaving Summer Villa to settle
in Wiltshire.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain that there will be a grand move
soon, from what I heard while I was waiting at
table,&rdquo; said John the footman. &ldquo;I mean to give
warning to-morrow,&rdquo; he added, shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better do nothing in a hurry,&rdquo;
observed Susan Pearl, a sensible, pleasant-looking
woman, who had been Emmie&rsquo;s attendant when she
was a child, and who acted as her lady&rsquo;s-maid now.
&ldquo;You may find that second thoughts are best, when
the matter in question is throwing up a good place.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then master had better have his second thoughts
too,&rdquo; observed John, as he stretched out his hand
for the walnut pickle. &ldquo;A week of Myst Court was
quite enough for me, I assure you. If you were to
see how the mortar is starting from the brickwork,
how the plaster is peeling from the ceilings, and
how the furniture is faded; if you were to hear the
windows shaking and rattling as if they had a fit of
the ague, the boards creaking, and the long passages
echoing, you would think any sensible man well
out of so dreary a prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plaster and paint can be put on anew, a carpet
deadens echoes, and curtains keep out draughts.
As for windows rattling, a peg will stop that,&rdquo;
observed Susan, who was not easily daunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Outside the house it&rsquo;s as bad as within,&rdquo; pursued
John. &ldquo;The drive is green with moss and
grass, and the piece of water with duckweed; the
trees grow so thick together that you can&rsquo;t see ten
yards before you; and your ears are dinned with
the cawing of rooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weeding and clearing will do wonders,&rdquo; said
Susan; &ldquo;if Miss Emmie were set in a coal-yard,
she would manage to make flowers grow there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there good shops near?&rdquo; inquired Ann, the
housemaid, who wore a cap of the newest pattern,
trimmed with the gayest of ribbons.<span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shops!&rdquo; echoed John, as if amazed at the
question. &ldquo;Why, the very baker and grocer have
to come in their carts from S&mdash;&mdash;, and there&rsquo;s
nothing like a gentleman&rsquo;s house within several miles
of Myst Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give warning to-morrow,&rdquo; said Ann. &ldquo;As
well be transported at once, as go to such a heathenish
out-of-the-way place as that is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that Myst Court is overrun with
rats and mice,&rdquo; observed Mullins the cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; answered John, laughing.
&ldquo;Thieving rats and mice would have had a hard
life of it with old Mrs. Myers&rsquo; nine and thirty cats
and kittens to serve as a rural police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;La, John, you&rsquo;re joking! nine and thirty!&rdquo;
exclaimed the women-servants in a breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not joking,&rdquo; replied the footman; &ldquo;I
counted them,&mdash;black, white, gray, and tabby,
long hair and short hair, blue eyes and green eyes!
Mrs. Myers cared a deal more for her cats than she
did for her tenants&rsquo; children. No, no, the rats and
mice would find no safe corner in that big old
house, unless in the shut-up, haunted chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whenever these last two words were pronounced,
curiosity was certain to be roused, and questioning
to follow. Three voices now spoke at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think that the place is really haunted?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any ghosts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do the servants say about that chamber?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last question, which was Susan&rsquo;s, was that
to which John gave reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cook and the housemaid at Myst Court say
that for certain they&rsquo;ve heard odd noises, a sighing,
and a rattling, and a howling o&rsquo; nights,&rdquo; said the
footman, looking as mysterious as his plump, well-fed
face would allow him to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On windy nights, I suppose,&rdquo; said the sensible
Susan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a sighing, and a rattling, and
a howling even here in Summer Villa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him tell us more!&rdquo; cried Ann impatiently,
for John&rsquo;s countenance showed that he had a great
deal more to impart. The footman prefaced his tale
by deliberately laying down his knife and fork,
though cold beef lay still on his plate; this was a
token that honest John was indeed in solemn
earnest. He began in a lowered tone, while every
head was bent forward to listen:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jael Jessel, the old lady&rsquo;s attendant, told
me that she had twice passed a ghost in the
corridor, and once on the stairs. It was a tall
figure in white,&mdash;at least seven feet high,&mdash;and it
had great round eyes like carriage-lamps staring
upon her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ann and the cook uttered exclamations, and exchanged<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
glances of horror; but Susan quietly remarked,
&ldquo;If Mrs. Jessel really saw such a sight
once, she was a stout-hearted woman to stay to see
it a second time, and a third. Did this brave lady&rsquo;s-maid
look much the worse for meeting her ghost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied John, a little taken aback by the
question. &ldquo;Mrs. Jessel is a stout, comfortable-looking
person. I suppose that she got used to
seeing odd sights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan burst into a merry laugh. &ldquo;John, John,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;this Mrs. Jessel has been taking a rise
out of you. She saw that you were soft, and
wanted to make an impression.&rdquo; Susan was helping
herself to butter, which, perhaps, supplied her
with the simile of which she made use.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jessel did not stay at Myst Court for
nothing,&rdquo; said John, who, possibly, wished to give a
turn to the conversation; &ldquo;she had not waited on
Mrs. Myers for more than three years, yet the old
lady left her five hundred pounds, a nice little
furnished house just outside the Myst woods, and all
the cats and kittens, which she could not trust to
the care of strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was made worth her while to live in a
haunted house,&rdquo; observed Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought at first,&rdquo; continued John, who had
taken up his knife and fork, and was using them to<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
good purpose,&mdash;&ldquo;I thought at first that I might as
well put my best foot forward, for that it would
be no bad thing to have a wife with five hundred
pounds and a house to start with; and,&rdquo; he added
slyly, &ldquo;with such a live-stock to boot, one might
have done a little business in the furrier&rsquo;s line.
But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, but,&mdash;speak out!&rdquo; cried Ann with impatience;
&ldquo;what comes after the &lsquo;but&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somehow I didn&rsquo;t take to Mrs. Jessel,&rdquo; said
John, &ldquo;and shouldn&rsquo;t have cared to have married
her, had the five hundred pounds been five thousand
instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s against her?&rdquo; inquired the cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing that I know of,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;but
when you see her, you&rsquo;ll understand what I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not see her; I&rsquo;m not going to Myst Court;
I could not abide being so far from London,&rdquo; observed
the cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall give miss warning to-morrow!&rdquo; cried
Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will you do?&rdquo; inquired John of
Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay by the family, to be sure,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Would I leave my young lady now, just when her
heart is heavy? for heavy it is, I am certain of that.
While she was dressing for dinner, Miss Emmie could<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
hardly keep in her tears. It is no pleasure to her
to leave a home like Summer Villa, where she has
nothing to cross her, and everything to please.
There&rsquo;s not a day but Miss Alice, or some other
friend, comes dropping in to see her; nor a week
that passes without some sight or amusement in London.
At the age of nineteen, a young lady like Miss
Trevor does not willingly leave such a pleasant place
as this for a dreary, deserted old country-house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor miss! I pity her from my soul!&rdquo; cried
Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a pity that would leave her to see none
but new faces in her household!&rdquo; said the indignant
Susan. &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll stick by my young lady through
thick and thin, were she to go to the middle of
Africa. I&rsquo;ve been with her these ten years, ever
since she lost her poor mother, and I will not desert
her now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,&rdquo; observed John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe my Bible,&rdquo; replied Susan gravely; &ldquo;I
read there that I have a Maker far too wise and
good to allow His servants to be troubled by visitors
from another world. This ghost-fearing is all of a
piece with fortune-telling, and spirit-rapping, and all
such follies, after which weak-brained people run.
Simple faith in God turns out faith in such nonsense,
as daylight puts an end to darkness.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>Susan was not laughed at for her little lecture as
ten years before she might have been. Her long
period of service and her tried character had given
her influence, and won for her that respect which a
consistent life secures even from the worldly. Her
fellow-servants felt somewhat ashamed of their own
credulous folly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid of ghosts,&rdquo; said Ann; &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t choose to mope in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a rap for a house being haunted;
but I mean to better myself,&rdquo; said the cook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think, John, that the young gentlemen
will like Myst Court?&rdquo; inquired Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Master Bruce has a purpose and a plan
in his head; and when he has a purpose and a plan,
it&rsquo;s his way to go right on, steady and straight, and
none can say whether he likes or don&rsquo;t like what
he&rsquo;s a-doing,&rdquo; answered the footman. &ldquo;When he
looked over the house, it wasn&rsquo;t to say how bad
things were, but to see how things could be bettered.
He has a lot o&rsquo; common sense, has Master
Bruce; I believe that he&rsquo;ll make himself happy
after his fashion, and that ghosts, if there be any,
will take care to keep out of his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d see through them,&rdquo; said Susan, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for Master Vibert,&rdquo; continued John, &ldquo;if he
has plenty of amusement, he&rsquo;ll not trouble his head<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
about ghost or goblin. He&rsquo;s a light-hearted chap
is Master Vibert, and a bit giddy, I take it. Perhaps
his father ain&rsquo;t sorry to have him a bit further
off from London than he is here in Summer Villa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one for whom I feel sorry is my young
lady,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not take a gun or a
fishing-rod like her brothers, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be mortally afraid of ghosts,&rdquo; cried Ann.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s timid as a hare,&rdquo; observed John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If miss screams when a puppy-dog barks at her,
and hides her face under her bed-clothes if there&rsquo;s a
peal o&rsquo; thunder, how will she face ghosts ten feet
high, with eyes like carriage-lamps?&rdquo; cried the
cook.</p>

<p>Susan looked annoyed and almost angry at hearing
her mistress spoken of thus. &ldquo;Miss Emmie
is nervous and not very strong, so she is easily
startled,&rdquo; said the maid; &ldquo;but she is as good a
Christian as lives, and will not, I hope, give way to
any idle fancies and fears such as trouble folk who
are afraid of their own shadows. I should not,
however, wonder if she find Myst Court very dull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d better take to amusing herself by looking
after the poor folk around her,&rdquo; observed the cook.
&ldquo;From what you&rsquo;ve told us, John, I take it there&rsquo;s
company enough of bare-legged brats and ragged
babies.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Emmie is mighty afraid of infection,&rdquo; said
John, doubtfully shaking his head. &ldquo;She has never
let me call a four-wheeler for her in London since
small-pox has been going about. Miss will cross to
the other side of the road if she sees a child with a
spot on its face. No, no; she&rsquo;ll never venture to
set so much as her foot in one of them dirty hovels
that I saw down there in Wiltshire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t fit as she should,&rdquo; observed Ann. &ldquo;Why
should ladies demean themselves by going amongst
dirty beggarly folk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To help them out of their misery,&rdquo; said Susan.
&ldquo;In the place where I lived before I came here, I
saw my mistress, and the young ladies besides, take
delight in visiting the poor. They thought that it
no more demeaned them to enter a cottage than to
enter a church; the rich and the poor meet together
in both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Emmie is too good to be proud,&rdquo; observed
John; &ldquo;but, take my word for it, she&rsquo;ll never
muster up courage to go within ten yards of a
cottage. Kind things she&rsquo;ll say, ay, and do; for
she has the kindest heart in the world. But she&rsquo;ll
send you, Susan, with her baskets of groceries and
bundles of cast-off clothes; she&rsquo;ll not hunt up cases
herself. Miss would shrink from bad smells; she&rsquo;d
faint at the sight of a sore. She&rsquo;ll not dirty her<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
fine muslin dresses, or run the risk of catching
fevers, or may be the plague, by visiting the poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; observed Susan. But from
her knowledge of the disposition of her young lady,
the faithful attendant was not without her misgivings
upon the subject.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>PREPARING TO START.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The question of a move was finally settled;
Myst Court was to be the future residence
of its new owner, who lost no
time in making arrangements for effecting in it such
repairs as were absolutely necessary to make it a
tolerably comfortable dwelling. More than this Mr.
Trevor did not at present attempt; his expenses,
he knew, would be heavy. His newly-inherited
property would yield no immediate supply; improvements
must be gradually made. The life of a
landed proprietor was one altogether new to Mr.
Trevor, who had passed thirty years of his life in
a government office, never being more than a few
weeks at a time absent from London. Being a
sensible man, he was aware that experience on a
hitherto untried path is often dearly bought. He
expected to make some mistakes, but resolved to
act with such prudence that even mistakes should
not involve him in serious difficulties.<span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p></div>

<p>The six weeks which elapsed before the departure
of the family from Summer Villa were full of business
and arrangements. Mr. Trevor, having to
wind up his office-work, and settle the affairs of his
late aunt, was, except in the evenings, very little
at home. Emmie, who acted as her father&rsquo;s housekeeper,
found a hundred small matters to arrange
before making a move which must bring so complete
a change. Her brothers attended a private tutor
in London, and usually went and returned by the
same trains as their father; so that, but for the
company of her uncle, Emmie would have spent
much of her time alone. But the captain was a
cheerful companion and a most efficient helper to
his young niece. He made up her accounts, he paid
her bills, he helped her to decide which articles of
furniture must be taken to the new home, which left
to be sold or given away. The slow-paced John was
astonished at the energy with which the naval officer
would mount a ladder, and with his own hands take
down family pictures and swathe them in the matting
which was to secure their safe transit to Wiltshire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure the captain does the work of three. One
would think he&rsquo;d been &rsquo;prenticed to a carpenter by
the way he handles the tools; and he runs up a
ladder like a cat,&rdquo; observed John to another member
of the household.<span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>Captain Arrows felt strong sympathy for his
niece. He saw, perhaps more clearly than did any
one else, how painful to her was the change which
was coming over her life. Her uncle respected
Emmie&rsquo;s unselfish efforts to hide from her father
her reluctance to leave Summer Villa and all its
pleasant surroundings. Arrows noticed the shade
of sadness on Emmie&rsquo;s fair face when she received,
as she frequently did, congratulations on her father&rsquo;s
accession to property. The acute observer could
not fail to see that the acquisition of Myst Court
was no source of pride or pleasure to Emmie.</p>

<p>Miss Trevor was perpetually reminded of her
approaching departure from the home in which her
life had been so much like a summer holiday.
Many visits of leave-taking had to be paid, and few
could be paid without more or less of pain. Emmie
had numerous friends, and to some she could not
bid farewell without a sharp pang of regret. Even
inanimate things, dear from association, were resigned
with sadness. Emmie sighed to take leave of her
garden, and spent much time in procuring cuttings
from her favourite plants, her geraniums, her fuchsias,
her myrtles. With what pleasant memories were
those flowers connected in the affectionate mind of
Emmie! Summer Villa and her friends seemed dearer
than ever when she was about to leave them behind.<span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>Next to the captain, Emmie found her best helper
in Susan. Active, thoughtful, the neatest of packers,
the most intelligent of maids, Susan was indeed &ldquo;a
treasure&rdquo; to her young mistress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to like the change,&rdquo; said the cook to
Susan, who was humming cheerfully to herself as
she knelt beside a hamper which she was packing
with china.</p>

<p>Susan did not pause to look up from her work as
she answered, &ldquo;I never ask myself whether I like
it or not; my business is to make ready for it, and
that is enough for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dismal a house looks when everything
in it is being pulled down and upset!&rdquo; remarked
the cook, standing with her back to the wall, and
watching Susan as she imbedded quaint old china
tea-pot and cream-jug in white cotton wool as carefully
as she might have laid a baby in a cradle.
&ldquo;The hall all lumbered with luggage; the whole
place smelling of matting; things awanted just
when they&rsquo;ve been packed up, corded, and labelled;
the walls looking without their pictures as faces
would do without eyes,&mdash;there is something horrid
uncomfortable about a house as has been long lived
in when it&rsquo;s agoing to be left for good. I&rsquo;m half
sorry that I agreed to stay on the extra fortnight;
only it was such a convenience to the family. I<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;d have done had Ann and I
taken ourselves off before the move was fairly over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan went quietly on with her occupation, while
Mrs. Mullins went on with her talking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps master did wisely to keep on Mrs. Myers&rsquo;
servants, for he&rsquo;d hardly have got London folk to
stay in his dismal country house, even on double
wages. We&rsquo;ll have you at the Soho registry before
three months are over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time will show,&rdquo; said Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them people down at Myst Court are accustomed
to the kind of life they lead there,&rdquo; continued
the loquacious Mrs. Mullins, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the reason
they don&rsquo;t mind it. Frogs like their ditch because
they&rsquo;ve never known anything better; and I suppose
that folk in a haunted house get used to ghosts, as
eels are used to skinning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or learn not to be frightened at shadows,&rdquo; said
Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not frightened; don&rsquo;t you fancy that shadows
keep me from going to Myst Court,&rdquo; cried the cook.
&ldquo;But I could never stand a place where the butcher&mdash;as
John says&mdash;comes but twice a week in the
winter; no cook could abide that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems that Mrs. Myers&rsquo; cook did,&rdquo; observed
Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no cook!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Mullins, with an<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
emphatic snort of disdain: &ldquo;she&rsquo;s had nothing to
keep her hand in, and don&rsquo;t know a <i>vol-au-vent</i>
from a <i>soufflet!</i> Why, Mrs. Myers never saw company,
never asked a friend to a meal! John says
that for five days out of the seven the old lady
dined on mutton-broth, and the other two on barley-gruel!
John told me that he could hardly touch
the dinners which Hannah prepared; he is used to
have things so very different,&rdquo; added Mrs. Mullins
with professional pride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Hannah&rsquo;s cooking satisfied master and his
son, John might have been satisfied too,&rdquo; observed
Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Trevor is never partic&rsquo;lar about his
food; and as for Master Bruce, John says that he
was so much taken up about arrangements, and
alterations, and improvements, that he would not
have noticed if the stew had been made of old shoes.
But Master Vibert, he&rsquo;s not so easily pleased; he
likes his dainty bits, his sauces, and his sweeties;
there is some satisfaction in dishing up a dinner for
him! He&rsquo;ll soon find out that this Hannah knows
just as much of cooking as I do of cow-milking, and
there will be a worrit in the house.&rdquo; Mrs. Mullins
folded her hands complacently at the thought of how
much her own valuable services would be regretted,
and then inquired, in an altered tone, &ldquo;Is the captain<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
going to Myst Court with the rest of the
party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I am sorry to say that the captain leaves
this to-morrow,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;He is before long
to start on another cruise, and as he has much business
to do in the docks, he needs to stop for awhile
in London. The carriage which takes the captain
away is to drop Miss Emmie at the house of her
friend, Miss Alice, to whom she wishes to say good-bye.
My poor dear young lady! every day brings
its good-bye to her now. It will be well when
Friday comes, and the move to Myst Court is fairly
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never go into a new house on a Friday; it&rsquo;s
unlucky,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Mullins, as she turned away
and went off to the kitchen.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>HAUNTED ROOMS.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_n.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="N" class="cap" />
<p class="cap12">November has come with nights of drizzle
and mornings of fog. The dreariness of
the weather without adds to the sense of
discomfort within the half-dismantled house. The
carpet has been taken from the staircase, and the old
family clock no longer is heard striking the hours.
The drawing-room is much changed in appearance
from what it was when the reader was first introduced
into the Trevors&rsquo; cheerful abode. It is evening,
and the family are sitting together, with the
exception of the master of the house, who is busy in
his study with lawyers&rsquo; papers and parchment deeds
before him. The light of the drawing-room lamp
falls on a scanty amount of furniture; for sofa, arm-chair,
and piano have all been packed up for removal
to the new home. No ornament of china, no graceful
vase relieves the bareness of the white mantelpiece;
the mirror has been taken away, no trace remains<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
of pictures except square marks on the wall. The
guitar has vanished from view; the globe of gold-fish
is now the property of a friend; the ferns have been
sent to the greenhouse of an aunt in Grosvenor
Square.</p></div>

<p>Emmie sits at the table with her lace-work beside
her, but her needle is idle. Bruce, the most actively
occupied of the party, is drawing plans of cottages,
and jotting down in his note-book estimates of
expenses. The captain has a book in his hand, but
makes slow progress with its contents. Vibert is
glancing over a number of <i>Punch</i>. The party have
been for the last ten minutes so silent that the
pattering of the November rain on the window-panes
is distinctly heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that we shall not have such weather as this
when we go to our new home,&rdquo; said Vibert, as with
a yawn he threw down his paper. &ldquo;The place will
need at least sunshine to make it look a degree more
lively than a lunatic asylum. &rsquo;Tis lucky that our
queer old great-aunt did not take it into her head to
paint the house black, inside and outside, and put in
her will that it must remain so, as a compliment to
her husband, who has been dead for the last fifty
years. Fancy bricking up the best bed-room!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such an act proves that Mrs. Myers was in a
very morbid state of mind,&rdquo; said the captain.<span class="pagenum">[49]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a misfortune!&rdquo; observed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misfortune! I should rather call it weakness&mdash;absurdity,&rdquo;
said Bruce, sternly glancing up from his
drawing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should call it a sin, a downright sin,&rdquo; cried
Vibert. &ldquo;Such a shame it is to make what might
have been a jolly country-house into a sort of rural
Newgate! I&rsquo;m afraid that even our best friends
will not care to visit us there. Why, I asked pretty
little Alice to-day whether she were coming to
brighten us up at Christmas, and she actually
answered that she was rather afraid of haunted
houses, especially on dark winter nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce smiled a little disdainfully; and the captain
suggested that perhaps the fair lady was jesting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; answered Vibert; &ldquo;Alice was
as much in earnest as were all our servants when
they gave us warning, because not one of them but
plucky Susan would go to Myst Court. Why, I&rsquo;d
bet that Emmie herself is shivery-shakery at the
idea of the house being haunted, and that she&rsquo;ll not
care to walk at night along the passages lest she
should meet some tall figure in white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie coloured, and looked so uncomfortable,
that her uncle, who noticed her embarrassment,
effected a diversion in her favour by giving a turn
to the conversation.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been tracing a parallel in my mind,&rdquo; he
observed, &ldquo;between the human soul and the so-called
haunted dwelling. Most persons have in the deepest
recess of the spiritual man some secret chamber,
where prejudice shuts out the light, where self-deception
bricks up the door. Into this chamber
the possessor himself in some cases never enters to
search out and expel the besetting sin, which, unrecognized,
perhaps lurks there in the darkness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak of our hearts?&rdquo; asked Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied her uncle. &ldquo;It is my belief that
not one person in ten thousand knows the ins and
outs, the dark corners, the hidden chambers, of that
which he bears in his own bosom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every Christian must,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;for every
Christian is bound to practise the duty of self-examination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you don&rsquo;t call every one who does
not practise it a heathen or a Turk,&rdquo; cried Vibert.
&ldquo;All that dreadful hunting up of petty peccadilloes,
and confessing a string of them at once, is, at least
to my notion, only fit work for hermits and
monks!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not talking about confession, but simply
about self-knowledge,&rdquo; observed the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, where ignorance is bliss,&rdquo; began Vibert
gaily; but his brother cut short the misapplied<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
quotation with the remark, &ldquo;Ignorance of ourselves
must be folly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vibert took up again the comic paper which he
had laid down, and pretended to re-examine the
pictures. But for the captain&rsquo;s presence the youth
would have begun to whistle, to show how little he
cared for Bruce&rsquo;s implied rebuke; for, as Vibert had
often told Emmie, he had no notion of being &ldquo;put
down&rdquo; by his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it easy to acquire self-knowledge?&rdquo;
asked Arrows, fixing his penetrating glance upon
Bruce, who met it with the calm steadiness which
was characteristic of the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like any other kind of knowledge, it requires
some study,&rdquo; replied Bruce Trevor; &ldquo;but it is not
more difficult to acquire than those other kinds of
knowledge would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that you come to a different conclusion from
that of the writer of this book,&rdquo; observed Arrows;
and he read aloud the following lines from Dr.
Goulburn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thoughts on Personal Religion,&rdquo; the
volume which he held in his hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One of the first properties of the bosom sin with
which it behoves us to be well acquainted, as our
first step in the management of our spiritual warfare,
is its property of concealing itself. In consequence
of this property, it often happens that a man, when<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
touched in his weak point, answers that whatever
other faults he may have, this fault, at least, is no
part of his character.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain read the quotation so emphatically
that Vibert again threw down his paper, and listened
whilst Arrows thus went on:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This circumstance, then, may furnish us with a
clue to the discovery: of whatever fault you feel
that, if accused of it, you would be stung and nettled
by the apparent injustice of the charge, suspect yourself
of that fault, in that quarter very probably lies
the black spot of the bosom sin. If the skin is in
any part sensitive to pressure, there is probably mischief
below the surface.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt that the author is right,&rdquo; observed
Bruce. &ldquo;Besetting sins cannot hide themselves
thus from those who honestly search their own
hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps some search all but the haunted chamber,&rdquo;
suggested Vibert. Captain Arrows smiled
assent to the observation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By way of throwing light on the question,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;suppose that each of you were to set down in
writing what you suppose to be your besetting sin;
and that I&mdash;who have watched your characters from
your childhood&mdash;should also put down on paper what
I believe to be the bosom temptation of each. Is it<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
likely that your papers and mine would agree; that
the same &lsquo;black spot&rsquo; would be touched by your
hands and mine; that we should point out the same
identical fault as the one which most easily and frequently
besets the soul of each of you three?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be curious to compare the two papers,&rdquo;
cried Vibert. &ldquo;I wish, captain, that you really
would write down what you think of us all. It
would be like consulting a phrenological professor,
without the need of having a stranger&rsquo;s fingers reading
off our characters from the bumps on our heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not speaking of the whole character, but
of the one sin that most easily besets,&rdquo; said the
captain. &ldquo;Would a close observer&rsquo;s view of its
nature agree with that held by the person within
whose heart it might lurk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Bruce, after a pause for
reflection. &ldquo;But the person beset by the sin would
know more about its existence than the most acute
observer, who could judge but by outward signs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the very point on which we differ,&rdquo; remarked
Captain Arrows. &ldquo;The property of the
bosom sin is to conceal itself, but only from him to
whom the knowledge of its presence would be of the
highest importance. I should be half afraid,&rdquo; the
captain added with a smile, &ldquo;to tell even my
nephews and niece what I thought the besetting sin<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
of each, lest they should be &lsquo;stung and nettled by
the apparent injustice of the charge,&rsquo; and feel, though
they might not say it aloud, that &lsquo;whatever other
faults they may have, this fault, at least, forms no
part of the character in question.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s hearers looked surprised at his
words. Vibert burst out laughing. &ldquo;You must
think us a desperately bad lot!&rdquo; cried he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle, I wish that you would write down what
you think is the besetting sin of each of us,&rdquo; said
Emmie, &ldquo;and give the little paper quietly to the
person whom it concerns, not, of course, to be read
by any one else. I am sure that I would not be
offended by anything you would write, and it might
do me good to know what you believe to be my
greatest temptation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you are going away to-morrow, you would
escape the rage and fury of the indignant Emmie,
however &lsquo;stung and nettled&rsquo; she might be!&rdquo; laughed
Vibert Trevor. &ldquo;Now, Bruce,&rdquo; added the youth
sarcastically, &ldquo;would you not like the captain to inform
you confidentially what he considers the tiny
&lsquo;black spot&rsquo; in your almost perfect character?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to my uncle&rsquo;s writing
down what he chooses,&rdquo; replied Bruce coldly. &ldquo;All
that I keep to is this,&mdash;neither he nor any other
man living can tell me a fact regarding my own<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
character which I have not known perfectly well
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were I to agree to write down my impressions,
it would be to induce you all to give the subject
serious reflection,&rdquo; observed the captain. &ldquo;It matters
little whether I am or am not correct in my conclusions;
but it is of great importance that no one
should be deceived regarding himself. I wish to
lead you to think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll not engage to do that! I hate thinking;
it&rsquo;s a bore!&rdquo; cried Vibert gaily. &ldquo;I know
I&rsquo;m a thoughtless dog,&mdash;ah, I&rsquo;ve hit the &lsquo;black spot&rsquo;
quite unawares! Thoughtlessness is my besetting
sin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My difficulty would be to single out one amongst
my many faults,&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that is humbug; you know that it is!&rdquo;
exclaimed her youngest brother. &ldquo;You have no
fault at all, except the fault of being a great deal too
good. I should like you better if you were as
lively and larky as Alice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saucy boy!&rdquo; said Emmie, and she smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, captain,&rdquo; continued Vibert, addressing himself
to his uncle, &ldquo;though we are willing enough to
read what you write, we won&rsquo;t be driven to anything
in the shape of confession. You may tell us
what is your notion of what lurks in our haunted<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
rooms, but we won&rsquo;t invite you in and say, &lsquo;Behold
there&rsquo;s my besetting sin!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want no confessions,&rdquo; said Captain Arrows.
&ldquo;I repeat that my only object is to induce you to
pull down your brickwork, draw back your curtains,
and search for yourselves; or, to drop metaphor and
speak in plain words, to lead you to make the discovery
of the weakest point in your respective characters
the subject of candid investigation and serious
thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to a certain degree this desired result was
obtained. Though Vibert laughed, and Bruce looked
indifferent, to their minds, as well as to that of their
sister, the subject of self-knowledge recurred at different
parts of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose that the captain can look further
through a mill-stone than can any one else,&rdquo; thought
Vibert; &ldquo;yet he has uncommonly sharp eyes, and is
always on the watch. No doubt he learned that
habit at sea. I am glad that he can detect some
fault in Master Bruce, who is a kind of pope in our
house, though I, for one, don&rsquo;t believe in his infallibility.
I wonder on what my uncle will fix as the
bad spirit in my haunted room. I should say&mdash;let
me think&mdash;I have never thought about the matter
before. Well, I don&rsquo;t take to religion as earnestly
as do papa and my elder brother and sister. I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
go twice to church on Sundays, nor&mdash;if the truth
must be owned&mdash;do I pay much attention to the
service whilst I am there. I&rsquo;d rather any day read
a novel than a serious book. I believe that&rsquo;s the
worst I can say of myself. The captain would call
that&mdash;let me see&mdash;would he call that irreligion?
No, no; that name is too hard. I&rsquo;m thoughtless, I
own, but certainly not irreligious. Impiety? Why,
that is worse still! I do not pretend to be in the
least <i>pious</i>, but still I&rsquo;d be ready to knock down
any fellow who called me the reverse. I&rsquo;m something
between the two poles. Levity? Ah, that&rsquo;s
the word, the precise word to describe my besetting
sin, if one can call mere levity a sin. I am no man&rsquo;s
enemy but my own; and not my own enemy either,
for I spare and indulge myself in every way that I
can. Levity may be a fault at sixty, but it&rsquo;s no
fault at all at sixteen. I should decidedly object to
be as sober as Bruce. He goes on his way like a
steady old coach, while I am like a bicycle,&rdquo;&mdash;Vibert
laughed to himself as the simile occurred to his fancy.
&ldquo;A bicycle is quick, light, not made to carry much
luggage, and a little given to coming to smash! Yes,
I skim the world like a bicycle, and levity is my
worst fault!&rdquo; Yawning after the unusual effort of
even such cursory self-examination, Vibert now set
his thoughts free to ramble in any direction, satisfied<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
that nothing of a serious nature could be laid to his
charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is strange that my uncle should imagine that
he can penetrate the recesses of the heart of another,&rdquo;
such was the reflection of Bruce, as, candle in hand,
he mounted the staircase that night. &ldquo;Captain
Arrows can but judge of my character by my outward
conduct, and he can have seen but little to find
fault with in that. I own&mdash;and with regret&mdash;that
in many points I fail in my duty towards my Maker;
but that is a secret between my conscience and God,&mdash;a
secret which no man can penetrate, and with
which no man has a right to meddle. Yet it is evident
that my uncle has detected some visible error,
whatever that error may be. I am aware that I
have a defective temper, but I have lately been gaining
some control over that which Calvin called an
&lsquo;unruly beast.&rsquo; I may, indeed, have betrayed some
impatience in my manner towards Vibert in the
presence of my critical uncle,&rdquo; thus flowed on the
reflections of Bruce as he entered his room, and
closed the door behind him. &ldquo;I now remember my
uncle&rsquo;s remarking to me that I might have more influence
with my brother if I showed him greater indulgence.
But who can have patience with Vibert&rsquo;s
follies?&rdquo; Bruce set down his candle, and threw
himself on a chair. &ldquo;Vibert has been a spoilt child<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
from his cradle, and now, when nearly seventeen
years of age, is no better than a spoilt child still!
Our poor dear mother made her youngest-born almost
an idol; my father is blind to his faults; Emmie
pets and humours him to the top of his bent; and
all the world does the same. Vibert is admired,
courted, and welcomed wherever he goes, because,
forsooth, his face is what girls call handsome, and he
can rattle off any amount of nonsense to please them.
Vibert does not mind playing the fool, and he plays
it to the life!&rdquo; Bruce paused, and conscience gave
a low note of warning to the elder brother. &ldquo;I am,
I fear, harsh in my judgment. Want of charity,
that is perhaps my besetting sin. I am too quick to
perceive the faults and follies of others. That is a
quality, however, which is not without its advantages
in a world such as this. I am not easily
taken in; mere veneer and gilding will not deceive
my eye. I cannot be blind, if I wish it, either to
my own faults or to those of others.&rdquo; Bruce thought
that he knew himself thoroughly, and that there was
no haunted room in his heart which he had not
boldly explored.</p>

<p>Emmie Trevor had her heart-searchings as she sat
silent before her mirror, while Susan brushed out
the long glossy tresses of her young mistress&rsquo;s hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would fain know what my dear uncle regards<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
as my besetting sin,&rdquo; mused the gentle girl. &ldquo;I
was so foolish as almost to fancy that one so loving
and partial as he is would not notice my faults, and
I am still more foolish in feeling a little mortified on
finding that I was mistaken in this. What defect
in my character is most likely to have struck so
acute an observer? My uncle cannot possibly know
how often my thoughts wander in prayer; how cold
and ungrateful I sometimes am even towards Him
whom I yet truly love and adore. It is something
in my outward behaviour that must have displeased
my uncle. Is it vanity?&rdquo; Emmie raised her eyes
to her mirror, and had certainly no reason to be dissatisfied
with the face which she saw reflected in the
glass. &ldquo;Yes, I fear that I am vain; I do think
myself pretty, and I cannot help knowing that I
sing well,&mdash;I have been told that so often. Then I
have certainly love of approbation; my uncle may
have detected that, for it is so sweet to me to be
admired and praised by those whom I love,&mdash;and
perhaps by others also. This vanity and love of
approbation may lead to jealousy, a very decided
sin. Did I not feel some slight vexation even at
Vibert&rsquo;s playful words about Alice, his wish that I
were more like that gay, giddy girl? I find Alice
nice enough as a companion, but would certainly
never set her up as a model. I am afraid,&rdquo;&mdash;thus<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
Emmie pursued the current of her reflections,&mdash;&ldquo;I
am afraid that I might be haunted by jealousy, if
circumstances gave me any excuse for harbouring a
passion so mean, so sinful. I have often thought
that for papa to marry again would be to me such a
trial. I could hardly bear that any one, even a
wife, should be dearer to him than myself. I should
grieve at his doing what might really add to his
comfort; and oh! is not this selfish, hatefully selfish?
It shows that with all my love for my only remaining
parent, I care for his happiness less than my
own. Certainly selfishness is in my character; it
lurks in my haunted chamber, and doubtless my
uncle has found it out! Then am I not conscious of
giving way to indolence, and harbouring self-will?
There are duties which I know to be duties, and yet
from the performance of which I am always shrinking,
making excuses for my neglect such as conscience
tells me are weak and false. Truly mine is
a very faulty character, yet am I given to self-deception;
the kindness and partiality of every one round
me help to blind me to my own faults, and perhaps
to draw me into a little hypocrisy, to make each
&lsquo;black spot&rsquo; more black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be observed that Emmie was no stranger
to self-examination; it was to the maiden no new
thing to commune with her heart and be still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>THREE WARNINGS.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_y1.jpg" width="100" height="86" alt="&quot;Y" class="cap" />
<p class="cap15">&ldquo;You are right, Bruce; it is certainly
desirable for you to go down to Wiltshire
to-day to make any needful arrangements,
and prepare for our arrival to-morrow,&rdquo;
said Mr. Trevor to his son on the following morning,
when the family were at the breakfast-table.
&ldquo;New servants will need verbal directions; and you
will see to the unpacking of the furniture which
I have sent down from this place, and to the
most suitable disposal of it in the several rooms
of Myst Court.&rdquo; The gentleman rolled up his
breakfast-napkin, and slipped it into its ring.
&ldquo;Your train starts at 10.30,&rdquo; he added, as he rose
from his seat.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Is Vibert to go with me?&rdquo; inquired Bruce,
glancing at his brother, who had, as usual, come
down late, and was still engaged with his anchovies
and muffin.<span class="pagenum">[63]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not think that Vibert would give you much
help,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No help at all,&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert quickly. &ldquo;It
may be just in Bruce&rsquo;s line to order and direct, see
that there are enough of pots and pans in the
kitchen, meat in the larder, and fires all over the
house; but as for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think it enough to eat the food and enjoy
the fire,&rdquo; observed the captain drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I positively must go to Albert Hall to-night;
the Nairns have asked me to make one of their
party, and I really could not disappoint them,&rdquo; continued
Vibert. &ldquo;It is quite necessary that I should
have a little amusement before going to bury myself
in the wilds of Wiltshire. As Moore the poet sings,&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;To-night at least, to-night be gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate&rsquo;er to-morrow brings!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair enough,&rdquo; observed the indulgent
father.</p>

<p>Bruce exchanged a glance with his uncle which
conveyed the unuttered thought of both: &ldquo;It is
scarcely fair that one brother should have all the
trouble and the other all the amusement.&rdquo; Vibert
noticed the look, and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duty first&mdash;pleasure afterwards&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
motto taught to all good little children!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Bruce, you are the elder, and like to be first, so<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
you naturally pair off with duty, whilst I am modest
enough to be quite contented with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor smiled at the jest, though he shook
his bald head in gentle reproof. Then turning to his
brother-in-law, he observed, &ldquo;Edward, I have an
early engagement in London, and must be off to the
station. I am afraid that I shall not find you here
on my return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I also start early,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Emmie
has ordered the conveyance to be at the door at ten.
I must therefore wish you good-bye now, thanking
you for my pleasant visit to Summer Villa, and
hoping next spring to find you all well and happy
in your new home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brothers-in-law cordially shook hands and
parted, Mr. Trevor going off to the station, as usual,
on foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Bruce,&rdquo; observed Vibert, &ldquo;if you have
the settling about the rooms at Myst Court, mind
that you give me a good one. I like plenty of air
and light, and a cheerful view. No poky little cabin
for me, nor an attic at the top of the house; long
stairs are a terrible bore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly give my first attention to the
accommodation of my father and sister,&rdquo; said Bruce;
&ldquo;they never think of themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hit at me, I suppose,&rdquo; cried Vibert with unruffled<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
good-humour. &ldquo;Ah! that reminds me of our
conversation last evening. Captain, have you been
hunting up the ghosts in our haunted rooms?&rdquo; asked
the youth as he rose from his place at the breakfast-table.</p>

<p>Arrows replied by drawing forth a memorandum-book
from the pocket of his surtout. He unclasped
it, and took out from it three minute pieces of paper,
neatly folded up and addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going upstairs to look after my luggage,&rdquo;
said the captain; &ldquo;I leave with you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These three private and confidential communications!&rdquo;
cried Vibert, playfully snatching the papers
out of his uncle&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Each one, I see, is
directed: here&rsquo;s yours, Emmie; yours, Bruce; and
here is mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Arrows did not wait to watch the effect
produced by his little missives, but quitted the room
to complete preparations for his departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m of a frank nature,&rdquo; said Vibert; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care if all the world hear my good uncle&rsquo;s opinion of
me!&rdquo; and, unfolding the scrap of paper which he
held, the youth read aloud as follows: &ldquo;<i>Be on your
guard against the</i> <span class="smcap">Pride</span> <i>that repels advice, resents
reproof, and refuses to own a fault.</i> I don&rsquo;t recognize
my likeness in this photo!&rdquo; cried the youth;
&ldquo;if the portrait had been intended for Bruce,&rdquo;&mdash;Vibert<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
turned the paper and looked at the back&mdash;&ldquo;sure
enough, it <i>is</i> directed to Bruce; and the captain has
hit him off to the life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You made the apparent blunder on purpose,&rdquo;
said Bruce with ill-suppressed anger, as he took the
paper from Vibert, and then threw it into the fire.
Then, after tossing down on the table the unopened
note which had been handed to him first, Bruce
Trevor turned on his heel, and quitted the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stung and nettled! stung and nettled! does he
not wince!&rdquo; cried Vibert, looking after his brother.
&ldquo;The captain has, sure enough, laid his finger on
the sensitive spot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so much vexed at your having read that
private paper aloud,&rdquo; said Emmie; &ldquo;it was never
intended that we should know its contents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It told us nothing new,&rdquo; observed Vibert.
&ldquo;Bruce&rsquo;s pride is as plain as the nose on his face;
only, like the nose, it is too close to him&mdash;too much
a part of himself, for him to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce is a noble, unselfish, generous fellow!&rdquo;
cried Emmie.</p>

<p>Vibert cared little to hear his brother&rsquo;s praises.
&ldquo;What is in your tiny paper?&rdquo; he asked, after he
had glanced at his own. &ldquo;Why, Emmie, you look
surprised at what our uncle has written. Tell me,<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
just tell me what lurking mischief the sharp-eyed
Mentor has ferreted out in you. Some concealed
inclination to commit burglary or manslaughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not quite understand what my uncle
means,&rdquo; said Emmie, gazing thoughtfully upon the
little missive which she had opened and read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could explain it&mdash;I could make it clear&mdash;just
let me see what the oracle has written!&rdquo; cried
Vibert, with mirth and curiosity sparkling in his
handsome dark eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you in return,
Emmie, what he has put in my scrap of paper:
<i>Beware of Selfishness.</i> Short but not sweet, and
rather unjust. I am thoughtless and gay, I care not
who says that much; but as for being selfish, it&rsquo;s a
slander, an ungenerous slander!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps our uncle has again laid his finger on
a sensitive spot,&rdquo; observed Emmie with a smile, but
one so gentle that it could not offend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know what the fault-finder lays to
your charge, what solemn admonition has called up
the roses on those fair cheeks!&rdquo; cried the younger
brother; and throwing one arm round Emmie, with
his other hand Vibert possessed himself of the paper
of the scarcely resisting girl, sharing her surprise as
he glanced at the two words written upon it. Those
words were&mdash;<i>Conquer Mistrust.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistrust of what or of whom?&rdquo; said Vibert.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
&ldquo;The oracle has propounded a kind of enigma: as
you are going to take a <i>tte--tte</i> drive with the
captain, you will have an opportunity of getting an
explanation of your paper. As for mine, it goes
after Bruce&rsquo;s&mdash;into the fire.&rdquo; Vibert suited the
action to the word.</p>

<p>About half-an-hour afterwards the conveyance
which was to take Captain Arrows from Summer
Villa was driven up to the door. Emmie was ready,
as arranged, to accompany her uncle part of the
way. John handed up his luggage to be disposed
of on the coach-box. Vibert came to the door to
see the guest depart and bid him farewell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show him,&rdquo; said the youth to himself, &ldquo;that I bear
him no grudge for a warning that was not very
necessary, and certainly not very polite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, captain,&rdquo; cried Vibert, as he shook
hands with his uncle; &ldquo;come to Myst Court next
spring, and you and I will make a raid on the
haunted chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Bruce? I have not wished him good-bye,&rdquo;
said the captain, pausing when he was about
to hand his niece into the carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce!&rdquo; called the clear voice of Emmie, as she
ran back to the bottom of the staircase to let her
brother know that the guest was on the point of departing.<span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce!&rdquo; shouted Vibert with the full strength
of his lungs.</p>

<p>There was no reply to either summons, and
Emmie suggested that her brother might have gone
out, not remembering that the carriage had been
ordered so early. After a few minutes&rsquo; delay,
Arrows handed her into the carriage, with the
words, &ldquo;You will bid Bruce good-bye for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None so deaf as those who won&rsquo;t hear,&rdquo; muttered
Vibert, when the vehicle had rolled from the
door. &ldquo;Bruce heard us call, but he is in a huff,
and did not choose to appear. He <i>repels advice, resents
reproof</i>, and yet won&rsquo;t believe that he&rsquo;s proud!
No more, perhaps, than I believe that I&rsquo;m selfish!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>MISTRUST.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_i1.jpg" width="100" height="87" alt="&quot;I" class="cap" />
<p class="cap15">&ldquo;I am so glad to have a little time for quiet
conversation with you, dear uncle,&rdquo;
said Emmie, as the carriage in which
she was seated beside Arrows proceeded along the
drive. &ldquo;I want to ask you,&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated, and her
voice betrayed a little nervousness as she went on,&mdash;&ldquo;what
it was that you meant when you bade me
<i>conquer Mistrust?</i>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Let me refer you to our old favourite, the
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;In
whose company did the dreamer represent Mistrust,
when he ran down the Hill of Difficulty to startle
Christian with tidings of lions in the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the company of Timorous,&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you no acquaintance with that personage?&rdquo;
asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you only mean that I am a little
timid and nervous,&rdquo; said Emmie, a good deal relieved.<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
&ldquo;That is no serious charge; you let me off
too easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, my dear child. Let us examine
the allegorical personages more closely. Timorous
and Mistrust are not only found together, but they
are very closely related.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would not have me a Boadicea or a Joan
of Arc?&rdquo; asked Emmie, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would have you&mdash;what you are&mdash;a gentle
English maiden; but I would have you <i>more</i> than
you now are,&mdash;that is to say, a trustful Christian
maiden,&rdquo; replied Captain Arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely courage is a natural quality, which belongs
to some and not to others,&rdquo; observed Emmie
Trevor. &ldquo;Besides, if it be a virtue at all, it is
surely a man&rsquo;s rather than a woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mere physical courage, such as &lsquo;seeks the bubble
reputation e&rsquo;en in the cannon&rsquo;s mouth,&rsquo; is not a Christian
virtue,&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;it may be displayed
by infidel or atheist. The courage which <i>is</i> a grace,
a grace to be cultivated and prayed for, is that childlike
trust in a Father&rsquo;s wisdom and love, by which
the feeblest woman may glorify her Maker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Faith in God&rsquo;s wisdom and love! Oh, you do
not surely think that I am so wicked as ever to
doubt them! I have many faults, I know, but this
one&mdash;&rdquo; Emmie stopped short, startled to find on<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
her tongue almost the very words which had been
given as a sign that the bosom sin had been tracked
to its lurking-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said Captain Arrows, &ldquo;that a
few days ago I listened to your singing that fine
hymn which begins with the lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Lord, it belongs not to my care<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether I die or live.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Emmie Trevor; &ldquo;and you told me
that, much as you admired that hymn, you did not
think it suited for my singing. I supposed that
you thought it too low for my voice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thought it too high for your practice.
Could it be consistently sung by one who that
morning had been in nervous terror at the scratch
of a kitten; one who owned that she would scarcely
dare to nurse her best friend through the small-pox;
one who, even with my escort, could not be persuaded
to cross a field in which a few cows were
grazing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, uncle, how can you take such trifles seriously!&rdquo;
cried Emmie, a good deal hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I wish you to take them a little more
seriously,&rdquo; replied Captain Arrows. &ldquo;You have
hitherto regarded <i>unreasonable fear</i> as an innocent
weakness, perhaps as something allied with feminine
grace, and not as a foe to be resisted and conquered.<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
I see that fear is at this time throwing a shadow
over your path; that you would be happier if you
had the power wholly to cast it aside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not the power,&rdquo; said Emmie. The words
had scarcely escaped her lips when she wished them
unspoken, for she was ashamed thus to plead guilty
to a feeling of superstitious alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us then trace the parentage of unreasonable
fear,&rdquo; said Captain Arrows. &ldquo;I use the adjective advisedly.
There are cases where the nerves are so
shattered by illness, or enfeebled by age, that fears
come on the mind, as fits on the body, not as a fault
but as a heavy affliction. There are also times of
extreme and awful danger, such as that of the Indian
Mutiny, when faith must indeed have had a dread
struggle with fear; though even then, in the hearts
of tender women, faith won the victory still. But
I am speaking of that fear which common sense
would condemn. Such fear is, must be, the offspring
of mistrust, and its effects show it to be a tempter
and an enemy of the soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What effects do you mean?&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These three at least,&rdquo; answered the captain.
&ldquo;Unreasonable fear hinders usefulness, destroys peace,
and prevents our glorifying God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not quite see how it should do so,&rdquo; murmured
Emmie.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It hinders usefulness,&rdquo; said her uncle; &ldquo;like
indolence, fear is ever seeing &lsquo;a lion in the street.&rsquo;
Does not fear hang like a clog on the spirit, <i>making
&lsquo;I dare not&rsquo; wait upon &lsquo;I would,&rsquo;</i> even when duty
to God and mercy to man is in question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arrows paused as if for a reply. Emmie gave
none; her eyes were gazing out of the carriage window
on the smoky veil which hung over the great
city which they were approaching; she knew that
she dared not do, what thousands of her sex are
doing, go as a child of light to carry light into the
abodes of darkness. Emmie had owned in her uncle&rsquo;s
presence that she was far too timid to visit the poor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then fear destroys peace,&rdquo; continued the captain,
&ldquo;and I believe that it does so to a greater extent than
does any other passion which troubles the soul, remorse
only excepted. If we literally and fully obeyed
the command so often repeated in Scripture, to hope
and to be not afraid, a mountain of misery would be
removed at once and cast into the sea. If you do
not mind a personal application of the subject, would
you, my dear child, feel uneasy at going to a house
which is called haunted, if you realized that God
fills all space, and that you are everywhere under
His loving protection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie still continued silent, looking out of the
carriage window. Her feelings were those of deep<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
mortification. That she, earnestly pious as she was,
should virtually be accused of want of faith, that
her deficiency in this first requisite of religion should
have been so glaring as to have attracted the notice
of a partial relative, was a trial the more painful
from being totally unexpected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bunyan represents Mistrust, the parent of unreasonable
fear, as a robber,&rdquo; pursued the captain,
referring again to that allegory which gives so wondrously
true a picture of man&rsquo;s spiritual state. &ldquo;We
first meet Mistrust in company with Timorous, and
their object is to discourage, to frighten, to make
Christian start back from the perils which would
meet him if he pursued the path of duty; when we
next hear of Mistrust, he is in company with Guilt,
and together they rob Little-faith of his treasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, mistrust does rob us of our peace,&rdquo; said
Emmie with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, let me touch on my third point, even
at the risk of giving some pain,&rdquo; said the captain.
&ldquo;Mistrust not only hinders usefulness, and mars
peace, but prevents our glorifying our Maker as we
might otherwise do. Is not the inconsistency of
His children dishonouring to God? And is it not
inconsistent to avow our belief that our Heavenly
Father loves us&mdash;cares for us&mdash;is about our path and
our bed, and yet to be as full of unreasonable terrors<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
as if, like the fool, we said &lsquo;there is no God&rsquo;?
The Christian knows that Christ hath &lsquo;abolished
death;&rsquo; he knows that to depart from earth is to
enter into rest; that light, and life, and glory await
the redeemed of the Lord. Is it not inconsistent,
I repeat, in one who believes all this, to shrink
with unconcealed terror from the barest possibility
that the time for his going home may be hastened,
even a little? The natural effect of strong faith
would be to make the righteous &lsquo;bold as a lion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle, you judge me very hardly,&rdquo; murmured
Emmie, ready to burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not judge you, dear child; I only warn
you not to cherish, as an inmate, that enemy whom
you have hitherto regarded but as a harmless infirmity.
Bring him before the bar of reason, bind
him with the strong cords of prayer. I have spoken
thus frankly to you on this subject, because I foresee
that on your conquest of mistrust, your victory over
unreasonable fears, must depend much of your peace,
happiness, and usefulness also, in the new home to
which you are going. A realizing faith in God&rsquo;s
presence, a simple trust in His love, these are the
most powerful antidotes against superstitious and
all other ill-grounded fears. The light that dispels
shadows is the words, <i>I will fear no evil, for Thou
art with me</i>.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>Captain Arrows had thus given to his sister&rsquo;s
children his warning against what, from close observation
of their characters, he deemed to be the besetting
sin of each,&mdash;pride, selfishness, and mistrust.
What had been the effect of his words? The
monitor had given offence, he had given pain, and
in one case, at least, his warning had been as the
dropping into a brook of a pebble, that scarcely causes
even a ripple. There are few who value gratuitous
counsel; the many prefer to buy experience, though
it should prove to be at the price of future pain and
regret. We are seldom thankful to him who would
explore for us the heart&rsquo;s haunted chamber, even
should we not possess the candour and moral courage
to search its depths for ourselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>THE JOURNEY.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="85" height="86" alt="O" class="cap" />
<p class="cap13">On the following day Emmie, escorted by
Vibert and attended by Susan, started
for her new home. Almost at the last
moment Mr. Trevor found that important business
would, for another day, delay his own departure;
but all arrangements for the general move having
been made, he would not defer it, preferring for the
single night to sleep at a hotel in London.</p></div>

<p>The bustle of departure took from its pain;
Emmie left her dear old home without a tear,
though not without a sigh of regret. Vibert was in
high spirits, for novelty has its charm, especially to
a temperament such as his. Mr. Trevor had given
to each of his sons a fishing-rod and a gun; and
Vibert was already, in imagination, a first-rate angler
and sportsman. It would have been difficult to
have been dull in Vibert&rsquo;s company during the
journey. Sporting anecdotes, stories of adventures<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
encountered by others, and anticipations of future
ones of his own, interspersed with many a jest,
amused not only Vibert&rsquo;s sister, but their fellow-travellers
in the same railway-carriage. The youth
had none of his elder brother&rsquo;s reserve, and took
pleasure in attracting the notice of strangers, having
a pleasant consciousness that in his case notice was
likely to imply admiration also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That handsome lad seems to look on life as one
long holiday, to be passed under unclouded sunshine,&rdquo;
thought a withered old gentleman, who
looked as if all his days had been spent in a fog.
&ldquo;Poor boy! poor boy! he will soon be roused, by
stern experience, from the pleasant dream in which
he indulges now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>About half-an-hour before sunset, the train in
which the Trevors were making their journey approached
the station of S&mdash;&mdash;, the one at which
they were to alight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your new pony-chaise is to meet us, Emmie, so
papa arranged,&rdquo; observed Vibert; &ldquo;but it must be
a commodious chaise if it is to accommodate four
persons, and all our lots of luggage. There are three
boxes and a carpet-bag of mine in the van, besides I
know not how many of yours. Then look here,&rdquo;&mdash;Vibert
glanced at the numerous et ceteras which
showed that the young travellers had understood<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
how to make themselves comfortable; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
shawl, and a rug, and foot-warmer, a basket, a bag,
three umbrellas, and a parasol, my hat-box, and a
fishing-rod besides! Are all to be stowed away in
the chaise? If so, it will need nice packing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce was to order a fly,&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he was to do it, he has done it,&rdquo; observed
Vibert; &ldquo;one may count upon him as upon a
church-clock. Now if I had had the arranging, I
should have been so much taken up with trying the
new pony-chaise, that I should have forgotten all
about the old rattle-trap needed to carry the boxes.
I wish that we had riding-horses. I shall never
give papa peace till he buys me a hunter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shrill railway whistle gave notice of approach
to a station; the train slackened its speed,
and then stopped; doors were flung open, and a
number of passengers soon thronged the platform
of S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is Bruce; he is looking out for us!&rdquo;
cried Emmie, as she stepped on the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the pony-chaise?&rdquo; asked Vibert, addressing
his brother, who immediately joined the
party. Susan was left to collect, as best she might,
the numerous articles left in the railway-carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lad is holding the pony just outside the
station, and the fly is in waiting also,&rdquo; was the<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
answer of Bruce. &ldquo;Where is the luggage, Vibert?
the train only stops for five minutes at S&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan will tell you all about it,&rdquo; cried Vibert;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a bag and three boxes, one of them a gun-case,
stowed away in the van. Mind that nothing
is missing. Come, Emmie, I must get you out of
the crowd,&rdquo; and, drawing his sister&rsquo;s arm within his
own, Vibert rapidly made his way to the outside of
the station, where a pretty basket-chaise, drawn by
a white pony, was waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In with you, quick, Emmie!&rdquo; cried Vibert,
with the eager impatience of one about to effect an
escape. No sooner had the young lady taken her
seat than Vibert sprang in after her, seized the
reins, caught up the whip, and calling to the lad
who had acted as hostler, &ldquo;My brother will pay
you,&rdquo; gave a sharp cut to the pony, which made
the spirited little animal bound forward at a speed
which raised a feeling of alarm in the timorous
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Vibert, stop! you must not drive off;
you must wait for Bruce!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for no one!&rdquo; cried Vibert, still briskly
plying the whip. &ldquo;Bruce would be wanting to
drive; but this time he has lost the chance,&mdash;ha! ha!
ha! There&rsquo;s my brave little pony, does he not go
at a spanking pace?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that you would not drive so fast, it
frightens me!&rdquo; cried Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frightens you! nonsense, you little coward!
Don&rsquo;t you see that thick bank of clouds in which
the sun is setting? We&rsquo;ll have a thunderstorm
soon, and that will frighten you more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope and trust that the storm will not
burst till we reach shelter!&rdquo; cried Emmie, whose
dread of thunder and lightning is already known to
the reader.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are running a race with it, and we&rsquo;ll be at
the winning-post first!&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert, who was
enjoying the excitement, and who was rather amused
than vexed to see his sister&rsquo;s alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Vibert, you don&rsquo;t even know the way to
Myst Court! Oh, I wish that you had waited for
Bruce!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It had never occurred to the thoughtless lad that
he might be driving in a wrong direction; so long
as the pony went as fast as Vibert wished, he had
taken it for granted that Myst Court would soon be
reached. The station had been left far behind; the
road was lonesome and wild; only one solitary boy
was in sight; he was engaged in picking up boughs
and twigs which a recent gale had blown down from
the trees which bordered the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ask yonder bare-footed bundle of rags to<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
direct us,&rdquo; said Vibert, and he drew up the panting
pony when he reached the spot where the boy was
standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, young one, which is the way to Myst
Court?&rdquo; asked Vibert in a tone of command.</p>

<p>The boy stared at him, as if unaccustomed to the
sight of strangers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we on the right road to the large house
where Mrs. Myers used to live?&rdquo; inquired Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, but you&rsquo;ll have to turn down yon lane
just by the stile there,&rdquo; said the urchin, pointing
with his brown finger, and grinning as if a chaise
with a lady in it were a rare and curious sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that the rustic could have told
us whether to turn to left or right,&rdquo; said Vibert, as
he whipped on the pony. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s a fair specimen
of my father&rsquo;s tenants, we shall feel as if we had
dropped down on the Fiji Islands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The direction given by the finger was, however,
perfectly clear, and the Trevors were soon driving
along a picturesque lane, where trees, still gay with
autumnal tints, overarched the narrow way, and with
their brown and golden leaves carpeted the sod
beneath them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pretty rural lane!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie,
as the chaise first turned off from the high-road; but
admiration was soon forgotten in discomfort and fear.<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
The lane was apparently not intended as a thoroughfare
for carriages, at least in the season of winter.
The ground was miry and boggy, and the pony with
difficulty dragged the chaise. There were violent
jerks when one side or other dropped into one of the
deep ruts left by the wheels of the last cart that had
passed that way. Vibert plied the whip more
vigorously than before, and silenced his sister&rsquo;s
remonstrances by remarking how darkly the clouds
were gathering in the evening sky. Young Trevor
was but an inexperienced driver, and ever and anon
the chaise was jolted violently over some loose stones,
or driven so near to the hedge that Emmie had to
bend sideways to avoid being struck by straggling
bramble or branch. She mentally resolved never
again to trust herself to Vibert&rsquo;s driving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will this lane never come to an end?&rdquo; exclaimed
Emmie, as the first heavy drop from an
overshadowing mass of dark cloud fell on her knee.
She was but imperfectly protected from rain; for
Vibert, in his haste to dash off from the station
before his brother could join him, had never thought
of taking with him either umbrella or shawl for his
sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes the rain with a vengeance, and this
stupid beast flounders in the mud as if it were dragging
a cannon instead of a chaise,&rdquo; cried Vibert.<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
&ldquo;These country lanes drive one out of all patience!
Ha! there&rsquo;s the rumbling of distant thunder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I trust that we shall reach home soon,&rdquo;
exclaimed Emmie, who, exposed to the heavy downpour,
shivered alike from cold and from fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suspect that we shall never reach home at all
by this lane,&rdquo; said Vibert. &ldquo;Take my word for it,
that little wretch has directed us wrong; I have a
great mind to turn the pony round, and get back to
the high-road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t turn, the lane is too narrow; you
would land us in the hedge!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie,
who thought that the attempt would inevitably lead
to an upset of the chaise. On struggled the steaming
pony, down poured the pattering rain; Vibert,
almost blinded by the shower and the gathering
darkness, could scarcely see the road before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The longest lane has a turning,&mdash;there is an opening
before us at last!&rdquo; exclaimed the young driver,
as a turn in the winding road brought a highway to
view. &ldquo;We shall reach Myst Court like two drowned
rats. Why on earth did you not bring an umbrella,
Emmie? I could not think of everything at once.&rdquo;
Vibert had, indeed, thought but of himself.</p>

<p>The want of an umbrella was to Emmie by no
means the worst part of her troubles; she was afraid
that her brother had indeed been misdirected, and<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
that they might be lost and benighted in a part of
the country where they as yet were strangers, exposed
to the perils of a thunderstorm, from which the
nervous girl shrank with instinctive terror. Emmie
had never hitherto even attempted to overcome her
fear; and though her uncle&rsquo;s words now recurred to
her mind, the idea of encountering a thunderstorm
after nightfall, without even a roof to protect her,
put to flight any good resolutions that those words
might have roused in her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a flash!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie, starting
and putting her hands before her eyes. She pressed
closer to her brother as if for protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall have more soon; the storm comes nearer,&rdquo;
was the little comforting reply of Vibert. As he
ended the sentence, the thunder-clap followed the
flash. The pony pricked up his ears, and quickened
his pace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad that we are out of this miserable
mouse-hole at last,&rdquo; cried Vibert, pulling the left
rein sharply as the light vehicle emerged from the
narrow, miry lane into the broad and comparatively
smooth highway.</p>

<p>At this moment the darkening landscape was
suddenly lighted up by a flash intensely bright,
followed almost immediately by a peal over the
travellers&rsquo; heads. The terrified Emmie shrieked,<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
and, losing all presence of mind, caught hold of her
brother&rsquo;s arm. The sharp turning out of the lane,
the pony&rsquo;s start at the flash, and the sudden grasp
on the driver&rsquo;s arm, acting together, had the effect
which might have been expected. Down went
pony and chaise, down went driver and lady, precipitated
into the ditch which bordered the high-road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_v.jpg" width="85" height="86" alt="V" class="cap" />
<p class="cap12">Vibert shouting for help, Emmie shrieking,
the pony kicking and struggling in vain
attempts to scramble out of the ditch, rain
rattling, thunder rolling, all made a confused medley
of sounds, while the deepening darkness was ever
and anon lit up by lightning-flashes.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Vibert! dear Vibert! are you hurt?&rdquo; cried
the terrified Emmie, with whom personal fear did
not counterbalance anxiety for her young brother&rsquo;s
safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not hurt; I lighted on a bramble-bush; I&rsquo;ve
got off with a few scratches,&rdquo; answered Vibert, who
had regained the road. &ldquo;But where on earth are
you, Emmie? Can&rsquo;t you manage to get up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; gasped Emmie; &ldquo;the chaise keeps me down.
Oh, there is the lightning again!&rdquo; and she shrieked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the lightning,&rdquo; cried Vibert impatiently.
&ldquo;How am I to get the pony on his legs?<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
he&rsquo;s kicking like mad; and, oh! do stop screaming,
Emmie, you&rsquo;re enough to drive any one wild. It
was your pull and your shrieking that did all the
mischief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vibert had had little experience with horses, and
to release, almost in darkness, a kicking pony from
its traces, or set free a lady imprisoned by an overturned
chaise, were tasks for which he had neither
sufficient presence of mind nor personal strength.
Glad would the poor lad then have been to have had
Bruce beside him, Bruce with his firm arm and his
strong sense, and that quiet self-possession which it
seemed as if nothing could shake. Vibert felt in
the emergency as helpless as a girl might have done.
Now he pulled at the upturned wheel of the chaise,
but without lifting it even an inch; then he caught
up the whip which had dropped from his hand in
the shock of the fall, but he knew not whether to
use it would not but make matters worse. Vibert
ran a few paces to seek for assistance, stopped irresolute,
then hurried back, thinking it unmanly to
leave his sister alone in her helpless condition.</p>

<p>Happily for poor Emmie, assistance was not long
delayed. Not a hundred yards from the spot where
the accident had taken place, two men were sheltering
themselves from the violence of the rain in a
half-ruined barn. The cries of the lady, the loud<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
calls for aid from her brother, reached the ears of
these men. Two forms were seen by Vibert quickly
approaching towards him, and he shouted to them to
make haste to come to the help of his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady there, under the wheel,&rdquo; said the
shorter and elder man to the other, when the two
had reached the fallen chaise. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better look
to her while I cut the beast&rsquo;s traces; it&rsquo;s lucky I
have my knife with me,&rdquo; and the speaker pulled a
large clasp-knife out of his pocket.</p>

<p>The united efforts of the men, assisted by Vibert,
soon were crowned with success. The pony, frightened
and mud-bespattered, but not very seriously
hurt, as soon as it was released from the harness,
scrambled out of the ditch. The light basket-chaise
was, without much difficulty, raised to its right
position; and Vibert helped to lift up Emmie, who
was half covered with mud, and almost in hysterics
with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, there&rsquo;s nothing to be terrified at
now; the danger is over. You&rsquo;re not hurt, are
you?&rdquo; asked Vibert, with some anxiety, for he loved
his sister next to himself, though, it must be confessed,
with a considerable space between.</p>

<p>Emmie scarcely knew whether she were injured or
not. She was too much agitated at first to be able
to answer her brother&rsquo;s question.<span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that there are any bones broken;
mud is soft,&rdquo; said the shorter man. &ldquo;I guess she&rsquo;s
more frightened than hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be composed, dear lady; the storm is clearing
off,&rdquo; observed the younger stranger, who had assisted
Vibert in releasing Emmie from her distressing position,
and who now helped to place her again in the
chaise. This person&rsquo;s gallantry of manner contrasted
with the almost coarse bluntness of his elder and
shorter companion. Vibert at once concluded that
the two individuals who had accidentally appeared
together belonged respectively to very different
grades of society.</p>

<p>The man who had cut the traces had had string
in his capacious pocket as well as a knife, and now
occupied himself in making such a rough arrangement
with the harness as might enable the pony to
draw the chaise. He effected his purpose with no
small skill; considering the imperfect light by which
he worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we in the right road for Myst Court?&rdquo; inquired
Vibert of this individual, as he was tying the
last firm knot in the string.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Myst Court!&rdquo; repeated the man in a harsh,
croaking tone, at the same time raising his head from
its stooping position. &ldquo;Are you some of the new
folk as are coming to the old haunted house?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>The question was asked in a manner so peculiar
that it arrested the attention even of Emmie. A
flash of lightning occurred at the moment, not so vivid
as that which had terrified her so much, but sufficiently
so to light up the features of the elderly man.
Miss Trevor was again and again to see that strange
face, but at no time did she behold it without recalling
the impression which it made on her mind when
first shown by that gleam of blue lightning. The
man might be sixty years of age; his nose was
hooked, so that it resembled a beak; his eyes were
so sunken in his head that in that transient glimpse
they looked like dark eye-holes; his hair, rough,
unkempt, and grizzled, hung in wet strands as low
as his shoulders, surmounted by an old battered felt
hat. Emmie felt afraid of him, though she could
not have given any reason for her fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are to live at Myst Court,&rdquo; replied
Vibert. &ldquo;Our father has just come into possession
of the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woe to him, then, for an evil spell is upon it!&rdquo;
muttered the man; and a distant rumble succeeded
the words like an echo. &ldquo;The thunder and lightning,
the darkness and storm, the mistaken way, the
stumbling horse,&mdash;omens of evil&mdash;omens of evil!
These things do not happen by chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that, instead of muttering unpleasant<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
things, you would give a plain answer to a plain
question, and not keep us shivering here!&rdquo; said
Vibert impatiently. &ldquo;Are we, or are we not, on
the direct road to Myst Court?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the taller stranger; &ldquo;but by
yon lane you can reach the high-road which leads
straight from S&mdash;&mdash; to the place of your destination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that urchin did misdirect us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Vibert. &ldquo;If I meet him again, I will break every
stick in his faggot over his back! Must we really
return through that slough of a lane, through which
we have scarcely been able to struggle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must retrace your way,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;As far as the high-road my path is the same as
your own, as I am returning to my quarters at S&mdash;&mdash;.
Perhaps you will permit me to occupy the vacant
place in your chaise (I perceive that there is a back
seat), as it would be a satisfaction to me to see the
lady so far safe on the road. I shall do myself the
honour of calling at Myst Court to-morrow, to inquire
after her health. My name is Colonel Standish,
at your service, and I serve beneath the star-spangled
banner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be glad of your company, sir,&rdquo; said
Vibert; &ldquo;and are much obliged for your ready
help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is lucky that old Harper and I were at hand,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
observed Standish, as he stepped into the low basket-chaise.</p>

<p>Vibert sprang into the front seat beside his sister,
but before taking the reins from the hand of Harper,
young Trevor pulled a shilling out of his waistcoat-pocket,
and tendered it to the old man. There was
light now afforded by the moon, for the rain had
ceased, and through a rift in the clouds the radiant
orb shone clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A silver shilling to him who has helped you to
reach the haunted house,&rdquo; said Harper, as he took
the coin and thrust it into a deep pocket. &ldquo;I trow
there will be gold for him who shall show you the
way to leave it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vibert laughed; Emmie shivered, but that may
have been from cold, for the night-air was clamp and
chilly, and her clothes were saturated with rain.
Vibert now turned the pony into the lane, but the
creature limped, and had evidently some difficulty in
dragging the chaise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beast is lame,&rdquo; observed Standish; &ldquo;he has
probably strained a leg in the fall. We gentlemen
must walk through the lane, where the ground is so
boggy.&rdquo; The colonel sprang from the chaise, and
his example was followed by Vibert.</p>

<p>At a slow pace the party proceeded along the tree-overshadowed
way. The recent rain had increased the<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
heaviness of the road, and the trees dripped moisture
from their wet branches over the travellers&rsquo; heads.
To Emmie, cold and damp as she was, and longing
for shelter and rest, it seemed as if that wearisome
lane would never come to an end.</p>

<p>Harper, uninvited, had joined himself to the party,
and his peculiar croaking tones were frequently
heard blending in converse with the clear voice of
young Vibert, or the more manly accents of Standish.
Emmie alone kept silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our friend Harper is a near neighbour of yours,&rdquo;
observed the colonel to Vibert. &ldquo;He has fixed himself
just outside the gate of your father&rsquo;s grounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I never pass through that gate,&rdquo; croaked
Harper. Neither Vibert nor Emmie felt any regret
that their forbidding-looking neighbour should keep
outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You call the place haunted?&rdquo; said Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haunted!&rdquo; repeated Harper, muttering the
word between his clenched teeth; and the old man
shook his grizzled locks with so mysterious an air,
that Vibert&rsquo;s curiosity was roused. He began to
question Harper on the traditions connected with
the place.</p>

<p>The old man was not loath to speak on the subject,
though he imparted his information, if such it
could be called, only in broken fragments; giving<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
as it were, glimpses of grisly horrors, and leaving
his hearers to imagine the rest.</p>

<p>Then Standish followed up the theme, and recounted
strange stories from the New World,&mdash;all
&ldquo;well-authenticated&rdquo; as he declared; stories of
haunted houses and apparitions, each tale more horrible
than the last. Such relations would have tried
Emmie&rsquo;s nerves, even had the stories been told on
some calm summer eve; but heard, as they were,
in a dark, dreary lane, on a chilly November night,
when she was wet, bruised, and trembling from the
shock of a recent accident, tales of horror seemed to
make the blood freeze to ice in her veins. Had
Bruce been present, he would have discouraged such
conversation; but sensational stories had charms for
Vibert, and he never considered that they might
work an evil effect on the sensitive mind of his
sister.</p>

<p>At last the open road was regained, and Standish
took leave of the Trevors. Rather to Emmie&rsquo;s surprise,
the colonel familiarly shook hands with herself
as well as her brother, as if the night&rsquo;s adventure
had converted them into old friends. Vibert again
sprang into the chaise; he was very impatient to
get at last to the end of his wearisome journey, and
urged the pony to as quick a pace as its lameness
permitted over the smoother road.<span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>The rest of the time of the drive was passed in
silence. The way to Myst Court was clear enough
from the brief directions given by Harper, of whom
the travellers soon lost sight in the darkness, though
he was following in the same track. Emmie had
thought of inviting the old man to take the back
seat in the chaise, but an intuitive feeling of repugnance
prevented her from making the offer.</p>

<p>Glad were the weary travellers to reach the large
iron gate which had been described as marking the
entrance to the grounds of Myst Court. The gate
had been left wide open to let them pass through.
The drive up to the house was rather a long one.
Emmie noticed only that it appeared to be through
a thick wood, and that the chaise occasionally jolted
over impediments in the way. To her great relief,
the weary girl at length distinguished lights in some
of the windows of a building which dimly loomed
before her. There streamed forth also light from the
open door, at which her brother Bruce was standing,
watching for the arrival of the long-expected chaise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>A FAINT HEART.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_w1.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="&quot;W" class="cap" />
<p class="cap18">&ldquo;What has delayed you?&mdash;where have you
been?&mdash;how comes the pony to be lame,
and Emmie all splashed with mud?&mdash;what
insane prank have you been playing?&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Such were the questions, each successive one
asked in a louder and more angry tone, which were
addressed by Bruce to Vibert when the brothers
met in front of the house. The lad attempted to
answer the questions lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only had a bit of an adventure,&rdquo; cried
he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in a dilemma, Emmie in a fright,
the chaise in a ditch, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None of your foolery for me, sir! You have
acted like a selfish idiot!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce, who
was in a passion more towering than any to which
he had given way before since the days of his boyhood.
While Vibert had been speaking, Bruce had
been engaged in half lifting Emmie out of the<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
chaise; but he turned round as he was supporting
her into the hall, and uttered his angry exclamation,
while his eyes flashed indignation and scorn.
Vibert bit his lip and cowered for an instant under
his brother&rsquo;s rebuke, conscious that it was not
altogether unmerited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan, take care of my sister; let her change
her dripping garments directly,&rdquo; said Bruce to the
maid, who was waiting in the hall, candle in hand,
to receive her young mistress. &ldquo;You will see that
your lady has all that she wants,&rdquo; continued Bruce,
who was ever considerate and thoughtful. &ldquo;I will
send up something hot for her to drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mix a tumblerful at once. The wine&rsquo;s on
the table&mdash;hot water and nutmeg in the kitchen,&rdquo;
cried a female voice that was strange to the ear of
Emmie. But the poor girl was too much exhausted
by the events of the evening to look much around
her; she was stiff and trembling with cold, and
bruised by her fall, and faintly asked Susan to show
her without delay to her room.</p>

<p>Emmie was conducted by her maid up a broad
staircase of oak, which ended in a corridor, of which
the length nearly corresponded with that of the
house. To the left were the apartments which had
been assigned to the use of Mr. Trevor and his sons.
Susan, on reaching the corridor, turned to the right,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
drawing back a large curtain of old-fashioned
tapestry, on which the life-size figures, wrought by
hands long since cold in the grave, were so faded
that their outlines could scarcely be traced by the
light of the candle carried by the maid. This piece
of stiff tapestry had been hung across the corridor
in order to keep off draughts from the aged lady who
had last inhabited Myst Court. Susan held back
the curtain till Miss Trevor had passed through the
opening thus made, and then the tapestry again
shut out one portion of the corridor from the staircase
and the other side of the house.</p>

<p>A cheerful red light guided Emmie to a room on
the right side of the passage. The light came from
a blazing wood-fire in the young lady&rsquo;s own apartment,
which she now entered, followed by Susan.
Glad was the weary girl to enjoy her home comforts
again. Wet clothes were quickly exchanged for
dry ones; Emmie&rsquo;s cold hands were chafed into
warmth; soft slippers were placed on her feet; and
while the fire shed its kindly glow over her frame,
the maiden revived, and began to survey with some
interest the features of her new abode.</p>

<p>The room in which Emmie found herself was of
good size; the ceiling had been freshly whitewashed;
the walls were panelled with oak; the
furniture, with one exception, had all been taken<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
from Summer Villa, and had a familiar appearance
which was pleasant to the eye of the maiden, and
made her feel grateful to Bruce for his thoughtful
kindness. It was Emmie&rsquo;s own chintz-covered sofa,
which Susan had wheeled close to the fire, on which
the tired traveller reclined; the screen was one
specially valued as being the work of her mother;
the guitar-case was seen in a corner; the rows of
prettily-bound books which filled the shelves of the
book-case looked as if they had made the journey
to S&mdash;&mdash; without even having been moved from
their accustomed places. Emmie was fond of
pictures, and had collected quite a little gallery of
them at Summer Villa. Bruce had taken care that
his sister should not miss one of them at Myst
Court. Here numbers of pictures, great and small,&mdash;portraits,
prints, coloured sketches,&mdash;adorned the
panelled walls, relieved by the dark background of
oak, from which they took all appearance of gloom.</p>

<p>It has been said that, with one exception, the
furniture of Miss Trevor&rsquo;s room had all belonged to
her former home; that exception was a tall press of
elaborately-carved oak, which rested against one of
the side-walls, between the fireplace and the window.
Bruce had not ordered the removal of this
press for various reasons. It was heavy, and had
probably remained in its present place since the<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
house had first been built, as the style of the carving
was antique, and the wood almost black with
age. Bruce had thought that a high press was a
convenient article of furniture for a young lady&rsquo;s
room; and this one was so handsome that, though
it matched nothing in the apartment except the
panelled walls, its beauty as a work of art might
atone for the incongruity.</p>

<p>The gaze of Emmie rested longer on that dark
press than on anything else in the room. Perhaps
she was trying to make out the meaning of the
figures carved in bold relief on the front; or,
perhaps, she was recalling one of the sensational
stories which she had heard that night, in which
just such a press as this had played a mysterious
part. Absurd as it may appear, the young lady
would have liked her apartment better if the handsomest
article of its furniture had not been left
within it.</p>

<p>As Emmie was languidly gazing around, while
Susan, on her knees by the sofa, was chafing her
young lady&rsquo;s feet, there was heard a tap at the
door. A woman then entered the apartment, bearing
a steaming tumblerful of wine and hot water.
As this person will reappear in the story, I will
briefly describe her appearance.</p>

<p>She was dressed in mourning, and wore a black<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
bonnet covered with crape flowers and pendants of
bugles. Her person was short and somewhat stout.
The round eyes, above which the sandy-coloured
brows formed not arches but an upward-turned
angle, gave her a cat-like look, which resemblance
to the feline race was increased by the peculiar
form of her lower jaw, and the noiseless softness of
her movements.</p>

<p>In an obsequious manner this personage not only
gave the reviving beverage to Miss Trevor, but
volunteered her unasked aid to make the young
lady comfortable, beating up her pillow, stirring the
fire, and making inquiries about her health in a
pitying tone, as if the fear of Emmie&rsquo;s having caught
any chill were to her a matter of tender concern.
Emmie guessed that the stranger must be the confidential
attendant of the late Mrs. Myers, and her
conjecture was soon confirmed by the woman&rsquo;s introducing
herself as Mrs. Jael Jessel. The young lady
did not like to give Mrs. Jessel a hint to depart,
though the tired girl would have been glad to have
been left to the quiet attentions of Susan. Jael
herself was in no haste to quit the apartment; and
leaning against the mantelpiece, began to converse
in a voluble way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not help running over from my new
home to see that everything was arranged comfortable-like<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
for the niece of my dear departed lady,&rdquo;
began Mrs. Jessel. &ldquo;I know the ins and outs of
this place so well,&mdash;it seems so natural to come
about a house in which one has lived for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother has arranged everything comfortably,&rdquo;
observed Miss Trevor. &ldquo;He came down
before the rest of the family on purpose to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; I see. Master Bruce is a clever
young gentleman, and he has done all that he
could <i>under the circumstances</i>,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jessel,
lowering her tone, as she uttered the last three words,
to a mysterious whisper. The black bugles in her
bonnet trembled with the shake of her head, as the
late attendant went on,&mdash;&ldquo;But if young Mr. Trevor
had taken the advice of one who knows what I
know, he&rsquo;d have had this room shut up as closely
as the one which is next to it,&mdash;I mean <i>the haunted
chamber!</i>&rdquo; Jael Jessel&rsquo;s round eyes glanced
stealthily from one side to another, as if she were
afraid of being overheard by some invisible listener.</p>

<p>Susan saw a look of uneasiness pass over the face
of her young mistress, and could not help breaking
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hannah has told me this evening,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that Mrs. Myers always slept in this room, and
that you, Mrs. Jessel, were on a couch beside her.
Since the room was chosen for her own by the<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
mistress of the house, it must have been considered
the best one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jessel did not condescend to address herself
to Susan, but in speaking to Emmie virtually gave
a reply to the observation made by the servant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor dear lady was perfectly deaf, she
could not hear what <i>I</i> heard; her eyes were dim,
she could not see what <i>I</i> saw,&mdash;or she would not
have rested a second night with only a wall between
her and&rdquo;&mdash;again Jael glanced furtively around as
she murmured&mdash;&ldquo;that fearful chamber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you see,&mdash;what did you hear?&rdquo;
asked Emmie, shuddering as she recalled to mind
the warnings given by old Harper.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jessel did not wait to be asked twice; she
was ready enough to impart to any credulous
listener her tale of horrors. Susan was hardly restrained,
by her respect for her young mistress, from
repeatedly interrupting the stranger, who was doing
her worst to fill the mind of a nervous girl with
superstitious fears at a time when bodily weariness
had prepared it for their reception. At last the
indignant lady&rsquo;s-maid could keep silence no longer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you bore for years, Mrs. Jessel, and without
being any the worse for it, could have been
nothing very dreadful,&rdquo; said Susan bluntly. &ldquo;My
lady knows that a good Providence is as near her in<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
this room as anywhere else, and that they who keep a
clear conscience need fear neither goblin nor ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, we shall see, we shall see,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Jessel, drawing her black shawl closer around
her, as a preparation for departure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
there&rsquo;s a being who knows the place that
would go through the wood at night but myself;
but, as you say, a clear conscience gives courage.
I wish you a good night, Miss Trevor,&rdquo; added Jael,
courtesying formally to the lady; &ldquo;but, to my mind,
you&rsquo;d have a better chance of one if you were to
sleep in a different room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Jessel quitted the apartment; but she left
behind her the painful impression which her words
were calculated to make on a mind such as Emmie&rsquo;s,&mdash;a
mind not yet sufficiently disciplined by self-control,
or influenced by faith, to bring reason and
religion to bear upon superstitious fears and nervous
forebodings.</p>

<p>Emmie rose from the sofa, and took two or three
turns up and down her apartment; while Susan
occupied herself in trimming the fire. The young
lady then stopped abruptly in her walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I cannot sleep in this room!&rdquo;
It was humiliating to utter such a confession, even
to a domestic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Emmie, if you would let me be beside<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
you to-night&mdash;&rdquo; began Susan; but Emmie did not
heed her attendant&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not close my eyes all the night, and I
do so sadly need rest. I will go to my brother and
ask him to make arrangements for at once changing
my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Master Bruce will be so much disappointed,&rdquo;
expostulated Susan. &ldquo;He has spared no pains to
have everything just as you would like it to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot sleep here,&rdquo; repeated Emmie, who was
trembling with nervous excitement. &ldquo;You will
soon move my things&mdash;I care not whither&mdash;so that
it be to the other side of the house, as far as possible
from the bricked-up room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie hastily quitted the apartment, and drawing
back the tapestry curtain, passed on to the head
of the staircase. The house appeared to her dreary,
empty, and cold, as she glided down the broad
oaken steps, almost afraid to look behind her.
Emmie soon reached the wide hall, and, guided
by the light of the lamp in the drawing-room, of
which the door was open, she entered it, and found
Bruce Trevor alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you feel rested, Emmie,&rdquo; said her
brother, advancing to meet her. The clouded brow
of Bruce still showed token of the angry altercation
which had passed between him and Vibert.<span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot rest in that room, dear,&rdquo; faltered
Emmie, avoiding meeting her brother&rsquo;s inquiring
gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not rest&mdash;why not?&rdquo; asked Bruce in surprise.</p>

<p>Emmie coloured with shame as she stammered
forth her reply. &ldquo;I know that you will think it
so silly&mdash;it&mdash;it <i>is</i> silly, I own, but&mdash;but I would
rather be in any other part of the house than next
door to the haunted chamber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is folly, Emmie, pure folly,&rdquo; expostulated
Bruce. &ldquo;You know that a great part of the dwelling
is at present uninhabitable, and cannot be used
for months. There are but two upper rooms fitted
up comfortably; the one is my father&rsquo;s&mdash;he chose it
himself; the other is given to you. Vibert and I
can put up anywhere; our two little rooms, just
beyond my father&rsquo;s, have been left as I found them,
save that the housemaid has been induced to clear
a few cobwebs away. I could not possibly allow
you, accustomed as you are to have comforts around
you, to occupy one of those bare cells at the coldest
side of the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should prefer&mdash;oh, so greatly prefer one of
those small rooms to my present one!&rdquo; exclaimed
Emmie. &ldquo;Where I now am expected to sleep, that
horrid tapestry curtain divides me from every other
living being, and I am so close to the bricked-up<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
room, that if so much as a mouse stirred in it, the
sound would keep me awake. Dear Bruce, you
who are so firm, and brave, and wise, you cannot
tell what I feel. If you love me, let us exchange
our rooms at once; you are not fearful and foolish
like me.&rdquo; Emmie was trembling; her hands were
clasped, and tears rose into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have your own way!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce, with
some impatience of manner. He was annoyed at
his sister&rsquo;s betraying such weakness, provoked at
his own arrangements being altered, and disappointed
at having taken in vain a good deal of trouble to
please. Without uttering another word to Emmie,
the young man quitted the room to give needful
orders, and did not return till the clang of the hall
gong summoned the Trevors to a late dinner.</p>

<p>The meal was very unsociable and dull. The
storm of anger between the two brothers had not
passed off, and Emmie was too much disheartened
by what had occurred to be able to act her usual
part of peacemaker between them. Bruce had not
forgiven Vibert his foolish prank of driving off with
Emmie, which had been the primal cause of the
accident which had occurred; and Vibert, stung to
the quick, had not forgiven Bruce his bitter rebukes.
During the whole of dinner-time neither of the young
men addressed a word to the other.<span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>The awkward waiting of the country lad hired
as a servant, which, at another time, might have
afforded some amusement to the young Trevors,
now only provoked their patience. Bruce disliked
the clumping tread and the creaking boots of Joe;
Emmie started when the noisy clatter of plates
ended at last in a crash. Vibert, whose lively conversation
usually added so much to the cheerfulness
of the family circle, scarcely uttered a syllable, save
to find fault with the cookery, which was certainly
none of the best. No one, under these circumstances,
cared to prolong unnecessarily the time spent at the
dinner-table.</p>

<p>But matters were little improved when the party
had retired to the drawing-room, to spend there the
remainder of the first evening passed together by
them in their new home. Neither reading aloud
nor music, neither playful converse nor game, lightened
the heavy time which intervened before the
accustomed hour for family prayers. Emmie thought
that the large drawing-room of Myst Court was but
dimly lighted by the lamp which had shed such
cheerful radiance in Summer Villa. The light
scarcely sufficed to enable her to trace the outlines
of the time-darkened family portraits which hung
on the dingy walls. The apartment was so spacious
that one fire could hardly warm it, so that it was<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
chilly as well as dark. The small-sized furniture
which had suited Summer Villa would have looked
mean in the handsome old saloon of Myst Court;
therefore faded carpet and more faded tapestry
remained, high-backed heavy chairs of carved oak,
and narrow old-fashioned mirrors whose frames the
lapse of two centuries had rendered dingy and dull.
Emmie&rsquo;s only occupation on that first evening was
examining these relics of the past. She thought
to herself that Myst Court was as gloomy as any
cloister could be, and sighed when she remembered
that she must regard it now as her permanent home.</p>

<p>At last Bruce, who had repeatedly glanced at his
watch, saw that it was time to call up the servants
for prayers. They came in answer to the summons
of the bell which he rang&mdash;the three new members
of the household looking awkward and shy, being
evidently unaccustomed to be present at family worship.
Bruce read the prayers, as was his custom
whenever his father was absent from home. But
there was a coldness, on that night, even in the
family devotions, of which no one was more sensible
than was he who had to conduct them. It was not
because the room felt dreary and cold, nor because
a death-bed scene had so lately occurred in the house,
that a chilling damp fell over even the observance of
a religious duty: Bruce, Vibert, and their sister had<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
all on that day been overcome by their several besetting
sins, and those sins were haunting them
still. Pride, selfishness, and mistrust cast deeper
shadows on the pathway of life than those merely
external circumstances which we connect with ideas
of gloom.</p>

<p>The spirit of Bruce was out of tune, and the
noblest words of prayer were, as it were, turned
into discord by the imperfection of the human instrument
that gave them sound. The leaven of
hypocrisy marred petitions in which the heart had
no share. Bruce had to ask for the grace of meekness,
whilst he was inwardly scorning a sister for
weakness and a brother for folly. Had he been
struggling to subdue the pride of his heart, such a
prayer would have been a cry for help from above;
but Bruce was attempting no such struggle. He
was not seeking to imitate One who was meek and
lowly; the sinner on his knees was preferring a
prayer for a grace which he did not care to possess.
If a remembrance of his uncle&rsquo;s warning against
pride had passed through Bruce&rsquo;s mind on that evening,
it had roused anger rather than contrition.
&ldquo;What is Captain Arrows, that he should probe the
hearts of others; let him look to his own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the high-principled young man, who was so
ready to act or to suffer for what he deemed the<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
cause of truth; he whose character was in human
sight almost without a blemish, was in a state in
which, according to Scripture, all his faith, knowledge,
and zeal could profit him nothing. Death,
if death had met him now, would not have found
Bruce with his face turned heavenwards, though he
had long since, with sincerity of purpose, entered
on the pilgrim&rsquo;s narrow path. He stood condemned
by the solemn words of inspiration, <i>If any man
have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of His</i>.</p>

<p>Emmie noticed with pain, after family prayers
were over, that her brothers went to their respective
apartments without so much as bidding each
other good-night.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>EVENING AND MORNING.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_h1.jpg" width="100" height="87" alt="&quot;H" class="cap" />
<p class="cap16">&ldquo;How foolish&mdash;how weak&mdash;how wrong has
been my conduct through this day!&rdquo;
murmured Emmie to herself, as, after
dismissing her attendant, she sat alone in the small
apartment which she had chosen for her own. The
room was a contrast to that which had at first been
assigned to the young maiden. The cell, as Bruce
had called it, did not possess even a fireplace, and
might have belonged to some cloistered ascetic. The
stained, dusky, peeling-off paper on the narrow walls
had its blots and patches made only more visible
by the whiteness of three large unframed maps,
which the practical Bruce had fastened up for his
own convenience. The young man had rather a
contempt for the luxuries in which Vibert always
indulged if he could; to the idea of Bruce they
were only suitable for ladies, or those to whom age
or ill-health rendered them needful. Bruce considered<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
it unworthy of a man in the prime of his
life to care about the softness of a cushion, or the
temperature of an apartment. Thus, in making
household arrangements, Bruce had selected his own
quarters with very little regard to personal comfort,
while he had spared no pains in trying to secure
that of his sister.</p></div>

<p>Emmie now suffered from her brother&rsquo;s unselfishness,
as well as from her own nervous fears. Hasty
arrangements had indeed been made to improve the
appearance of the cell. Some of Emmie&rsquo;s books
had been transferred to the bookcase by Susan, nor
had footstool or guitar been forgotten; but for her
sofa there was no space, and the young lady&rsquo;s
toilette-table, draped with white muslin, looked
incongruous in so mean an apartment. Perhaps
the discomfort of that fireless room on a damp November
night was not without its effect on the spirits
of Emmie, who was accustomed to the refinements
and elegances of civilized life, and who was not
indifferent to them; but the melancholy which
oppressed the maiden chiefly rose from a deeper
source, a profound discontent with herself.</p>

<p>It was Emmie&rsquo;s custom to review, every night
ere she went to rest, the events of the preceding
day, with self-examination as to the part which she
had acted. The review had hitherto been very<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
imperfect, for she had never traced her errors in
practice to the source from whence most of them
had proceeded. Instead of recognizing <i>mistrust</i> as
a besetting sin, it had hardly occurred to Emmie
that it was anything meriting blame. The occurrences
of that Friday had been a striking comment
upon the words of her uncle, which Emmie now
recalled to memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unreasonable fear,&mdash;uncontrolled fear,&mdash;what
has it done for me to-day?&rdquo; mused Emmie. &ldquo;It
has destroyed my peace, most utterly destroyed it,
and cast needless gloom over my arrival in my new
home. Fear has made me displease both my
brothers, has lowered me in the eyes even of my
servants; it has caused an accident which has been
painful, and which, but for Heaven&rsquo;s mercy, might
have even been fatal. Should I have lost self-command
in the storm, had I recognized the
presence of Him who grasps the lightning in His
hand, and whose voice is heard in the thunder? If
my heart were indeed the abode of His Spirit, would
that heart fail me at the bare thought of&mdash;hark!
what was that sound?&rdquo; Emmie started and turned
pale at the cry of an owl outside her window; in
her home near London she had never heard the hoot
of the bird of night. The cry was repeated, and
though the nervous girl now guessed its cause, in<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
her superstitious mind it was still linked with fearful
fancies.</p>

<p>Emmie, to compose herself, took up her Bible,
and opening it, turned to the Twenty-seventh Psalm.
She read the heart-stirring verse: <i>The Lord is my
light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be
afraid?</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why cannot I make this glorious assurance of
faith my own?&rdquo; thought Emmie. &ldquo;Why am I, a
Christian girl in an English home, troubled with
fears which would better beseem some poor ignorant
African, worshipping his fetich, and knowing nothing
of a protecting, loving God! I must struggle
against this enemy, mistrust; I must try to bring
my very thoughts into subjection,&mdash;those thoughts
now so full of fears dishonouring to my gracious
Master. Where is my reason,&mdash;where is my faith?
I cannot believe that there is real danger in sleeping
next to the bricked-up room, or even my selfishness
would hardly have induced me to put dear Bruce in
a post of peril. I must have been secretly assured
that the danger existed only in fancy. But I am
now too weary to be able to reason; I need a
night&rsquo;s rest to enable me to distinguish between
facts and the creations of an excited brain. I am
so tired&mdash;my nerves are so weak! I shall scarcely<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
now be able to rouse my mind even for the exercise
of prayer, and by prayer alone dare I hope to conquer
mistrust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s rest was on that night troubled by a
confused medley of dreams, the natural consequences
of the excitement which she had undergone through
the preceding day. Nothing was distinct, but the
images of Harper and Jael Jessel mixed themselves
up with the phantoms which their weird stories
had raised in the imaginative mind of the girl.
Emmie, early deprived of the guidance of a sensible
mother, had often made an unprofitable use of her
leisure; she had read much of the literature which
is called sensational; she had pondered over tales
of horror; her mind had been fed on unwholesome
food. Emmie had let fancy lead her where it list,
and it would be no easy task to undo the mischief
wrought in idle hours under the name of amusement.</p>

<p>Morning came at last, and brightness and hope
with the morning. How different objects appear in
sunshine from what they seem to be when only
faintly visible at night! Emmie gazed from her
window, and greatly admired the prospect before
her. Never, perhaps, in a well-wooded country,
does Nature display more exquisite beauty than
in the early part of November, when the foliage,<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
thinned indeed, but brilliant in tints of crimson
and gold, varied with russet and green, is lit up by
the glorious sun. The orb of day, just rising, was
overhung by rosy clouds; the air was fresh and
fragrant after the storm; myriads of dew-drops
glittered on the lawn; all was brightness above and
below! Emmie thought that she could be very
happy even at Myst Court, and anticipated with
pleasure looking over the mansion, exploring the
grounds, and examining the state of the garden.</p>

<p>When Emmie quitted her little room, the sunlight
was streaming through the large east window which
lighted the staircase, throwing gorgeous stains of
crimson and azure from its coloured panes upon the
wide oaken steps. What had been dreary and
ghost-like by night, had become picturesque and
romantic by day. Emmie tripped lightly down to
the breakfast-room, where she found Bruce looking
out his place in the book of family prayers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you sleep well?&rdquo; was the sister&rsquo;s eager
greeting as she approached her brother; for Emmie
had reproached herself a little for exposing Bruce
to the chance of any nocturnal annoyance by the
exchange of the rooms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I slept very well,&mdash;never better,&rdquo; replied Bruce
with a slightly sarcastic smile. &ldquo;I had no expectation
of seeing goblin or ghost, and was certainly<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
troubled by none. I never knew a place more perfectly
still; so far as I could judge, not a mouse
stirred or a cricket chirrupped in the so-called
haunted chamber. But that west room is by far too
pretty and luxurious for a student like me. As
ladies are allowed to change their minds once, I
would strongly advise you, Emmie, to let us resume
the first arrangement: do you go back to the west
room, and let me study or sulk in my own little
cell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; replied Emmie Trevor; and, to do
her justice, her motive in declining the second change
was as much consideration for her brother&rsquo;s comfort
as the repugnance, which she had not yet quite
overcome, to sleeping next door to the haunted
chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why has Master Vibert not made his appearance
either at prayers or at breakfast?&rdquo; asked
Bruce, when, half an hour afterwards, he was enjoying
the cup of hot coffee prepared by his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert was tired last night, and has probably
overslept himself,&rdquo; replied Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;for I saw him from my
window this morning, more than an hour ago,
loitering about the grounds. Vibert must have
heard the gong sound for breakfast. No; the fact
is&mdash;you must have seen it from his manner last<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
evening&mdash;that Vibert is in a huff because I called
him a selfish idiot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so very, <i>very</i> sorry that you called him
that,&rdquo; cried Emmie, with a look of distress. &ldquo;You
do not consider, dear Bruce, what real harm your
sternness may do to our younger brother. Vibert is
so affectionate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He cares for no one on earth but himself,&rdquo; said
Bruce. &ldquo;Look at his conduct yesterday, and think
what might have been its result.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Driving off from the station without waiting
for you was but a foolish, boyish prank,&rdquo; pleaded
Emmie. &ldquo;As for the accident that occurred, that
cannot be laid to Vibert&rsquo;s charge; it was caused by
my catching hold of his arm just when the pony was
turning a corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you do that?&rdquo; inquired Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was foolishly frightened at the lightning,&rdquo; replied
Emmie meekly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frightened, always frightened, at everything
and at nothing!&rdquo; said Bruce, but rather in sorrow
than in anger. He was far more indulgent to the
failings of Emmie than he was to those of Vibert.</p>

<p>The gentle girl, who was very anxious to bring
about a reconciliation between her two brothers
continued her mild expostulation with Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure that you do not think Vibert an<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
idiot, though he may, perhaps, be a little selfish. I
have heard you say yourself that Vibert has plenty
of brain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he were not too lazy and self-indulgent to
work it,&rdquo; interrupted the elder brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not think&mdash;you never have thought
poor dear Vibert a selfish idiot,&rdquo; persisted Emmie;
&ldquo;and oh! Bruce, if I could only persuade you to tell
him that you are sorry for having spoken that one
hasty word, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apologize to Vibert! never!&rdquo; cried Bruce, and
he pushed his chair back from the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely it is noble, generous, right to own to a
brother that in a hasty moment we have done him
a wrong!&rdquo; said Emmie with an earnestness which
brought the moisture into her eyes.</p>

<p>Bruce made no reply to his sister, but rose from
his seat and left the room; not hurriedly, not passionately,
but with that expression on his calm face
in which Emmie easily read the unuttered thought,
&ldquo;I need no one&rsquo;s advice to guide me, and I will
receive rebuke from no one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie breathed a heavy sigh. Bruce was in other
points so noble, so good,&mdash;oh, why did he shut and
bar so firmly against the entrance of duty and affection
one haunted room of his heart! Emmie was
distressed on account of Vibert; she knew that her<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
volatile younger brother needed the support of the
stronger sense, the firmer principle of the elder,&mdash;that
the influence of Bruce might be of inestimable importance
to Vibert. And all this influence was to
be worse than thrown away, because the professed
follower of Him who was meek and lowly would
not bend his proud spirit to own that he had committed
a fault!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>THE STRANGER.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="85" height="86" alt="B" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">Bruce had scarcely quitted the breakfast-room
before it was entered by Vibert.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Quick, Emmie, a cup of your delicious
hot coffee! I&rsquo;ve been out these two hours,
and have come in with a hunter&rsquo;s appetite!&rdquo; exclaimed
the youth, who was looking even handsomer
than usual, with his clear complexion brightened
by the invigorating effects of the fresh morning
air. Vibert applied himself with energy to the
work of cutting slices from the cold ham which had
been placed on the side-board.</p>

<p>Emmie poured out the warm beverage for her
brother, who turned round to bid her add plenty
of cream. &ldquo;Cream is the one country luxury to
balance against country cookery,&rdquo; he laughingly
observed. &ldquo;If that virago-looking Hannah continue
to reign in the kitchen, I shall be driven to live
upon cream, or be famished!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>Vibert did not appear likely to be famished as he
sat at the well-spread table, doing ample justice to
his slices of ham. Emmie had finished her own
breakfast, but remained to keep her brother company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you were such an early riser to-day,&rdquo; she
observed, &ldquo;why were you absent from prayers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t stand hearing the prayers read
by Bruce!&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert with some indignation.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mockery for him to call his own brother a
selfish idiot, to treat him as if he were a slave or a
dog, and then to kneel down and pray like a saint,
asking for meekness and mercy, and all kinds of
graces which he never had, and never wishes to
have. If that be not downright hypocrisy, I know
not what is deserving of the name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce is the very last person in the world who
would play the hypocrite,&rdquo; cried Emmie. &ldquo;As for
the harsh name which he gave you, I believe that in
his heart he is sorry for what he said in a moment
of ill-humour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why does he not own frankly that he is
sorry?&rdquo; cried Vibert. &ldquo;If Bruce would but confess
that he regrets his hasty words, I&rsquo;d hold out my
hand at once and say, &lsquo;Let by-gones be by-gones,
old boy; I&rsquo;m not the fellow to harbour a grudge.&rsquo;
But Bruce would not own a fault were it to save his
life or mine. Pride&mdash;that pride that repels advice,<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
resents reproof, and refuses to acknowledge an error
(how well the captain described it!)&mdash;that is Bruce&rsquo;s
pet sin, and he&rsquo;ll carry it with him to his grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; faintly murmured Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce and I are to begin daily studies at S&mdash;&mdash;
next Monday,&rdquo; continued Vibert, who was making
good progress with his breakfast whilst he kept up the
conversation. &ldquo;I know that papa imagines that the
way to keep me safe and out of mischief, is to yoke
me to one whom he considers the impersonification
of sense and sobriety. He&rsquo;d couple a greyhound with
a surly mastiff; but the greyhound, at least, will
strain hard against the connecting strap. If Bruce
start early, I will start late; if he walk fast, I will
walk slowly; I&rsquo;ll keep as wide apart from him as
the tether will let me get;&mdash;in plain words, I&rsquo;ll have
as little to do with Bruce as I possibly can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert, dear Vibert, it so grieves me that you
should feel thus towards him,&rdquo; cried Emmie. &ldquo;Bruce
is not without his faults, but he is a noble-minded,
unselfish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unselfish! I deny it!&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert, while
he kept the morsel which he was just about to convey
to his lips suspended on his fork. &ldquo;Unselfish
indeed! when he has taken advantage of being sent
on in front to make arrangements to secure the very
best room in the house for himself!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He never did,&rdquo; cried Emmie eagerly. &ldquo;The
west room was prepared for me, but I could not
endure it, and, as a matter of kindness, Bruce exchanged
our respective apartments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why could you not endure that capital room?&rdquo;
asked Vibert in surprise.</p>

<p>Emmie, who had been wishing, praying that she
might be enabled to act the part of a faithful counsellor
and friend to her younger brother, felt painfully
that she had to step down from her position of
vantage, as she owned, with a blush, that she had
not liked to sleep next door to the bricked-up room.</p>

<p>Vibert burst out laughing. &ldquo;So the chivalrous
Bruce took the dangerous post!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Would I not just like to give him a fright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, oh! don&rsquo;t play any foolish practical
joke!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that it would not answer,&rdquo; said
Vibert, still laughing. &ldquo;Bruce is a hard-headed
chap, who sifts everything to the bottom. He&rsquo;d be
as likely as not to cleave a ghost&rsquo;s skull with a
poker, and I&rsquo;ve no fancy to try whether he hits as
hard with his hand as he yesterday did with his
tongue. But let&rsquo;s talk no more about Bruce. As
soon as I&rsquo;ve finished my breakfast, you and I shall
go into the grounds and have a ramble together.
You&rsquo;ve not yet seen the outside of our mansion, for<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
when we arrived here last night you had not enough
light to distinguish Aladdin&rsquo;s palace from a Hottentot
kraal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brother and sister soon sauntered out on the
terrace on the east side of the house, which was
bathed in glowing sunshine. The air was so mild
that Emmie had merely thrown a light blue scarf
over her head and shoulders as a protection from the
breeze; winter wraps would have been oppressive,
and she enjoyed the luxury of being able to go out
without donning bonnet or gloves. The terrace
overlooked the lawn and the garden: the latter
had once been fine, and had still a prim grace of
its own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather like this old family mansion,&rdquo; cried
Vibert, glancing up at the building, which had been
constructed of dark red brick, with handsome facings
of stone. &ldquo;There is something stately about
it, as if it had seen better days, and remembered
them still. Myst Court looks something like
William and Mary&rsquo;s part of Hampton Court Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a mere miniature of that grand old building,&rdquo;
said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can just fancy the kind of people who walked
on this terrace when first it was laid out,&rdquo; continued
Vibert. &ldquo;There were gentlemen in huge, full-bottomed
wigs, long coats, embroidered waistcoats<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
and ruffles of old point-lace, with rapiers hanging at
their sides. There were ladies like those whom Sir
Godfrey Kneller painted, stiff and stately, each
smelling a rose which she held in her hand; ladies
in hoops, who looked as if they could never dance
anything more lively than a <i>minuet de la cour</i>.
We seem too modern, Emmie, to match our mansion.
Let&rsquo;s return to the olden times, forget that Queen
Anne is dead, and fancy her yet with the sharp-tongued
Duchess Sarah playing the game of romantic
friendship. Let&rsquo;s imagine ourselves as we would
have appeared some hundred and fifty years ago.
I&rsquo;m a young Tory gallant (of course, I&rsquo;m a Jacobite
at heart, and drink to &lsquo;the king over the water&rsquo;);
Bruce is a decided Whig,&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure that he is
not a Dutchman, and has come over from Holland
in the train of the Prince of Orange.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie laughed at Vibert&rsquo;s playful fancies, and
wondered how her handsome young brother would
have looked in a full-bottomed wig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whig and Tory must unite,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;to
get that garden into order. The walks are overrun
with shepherd&rsquo;s purse and chickweed, and the
beds seem to grow little but nettles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these beds were clearly laid out at the time
when Dutch taste prevailed,&rdquo; said Vibert; &ldquo;it reminds
one of the poet&rsquo;s description,&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Grove nods at grove, each alley has its brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One half the garden just reflects the other.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;Rather a mournful reflection now,&rdquo; observed
Emmie with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But easily changed to a bright one!&rdquo; cried
Vibert; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll set plenty of hands to work, and
get everything right before spring. These old
straggling bushes must come up; we&rsquo;ll have new
plants from a nursery-garden, and fill those beds
with geraniums, fuchsias, and calceolaria. An
orangery, as at Hampton Court, shall be at one end
of the house; and we must fix on a site for a conservatory,
in which some huge vine shall spread
out its branches, heavy with delicious bunches of
grapes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy, you speak as if papa had the
purse of Fortunatus,&rdquo; said Emmie. &ldquo;You know
that he will have all kinds of expense in getting the
property into tolerable order,&mdash;draining, and that
sort of thing. The garden must wait for new
plants, and we for conservatory and orangery, till
more important matters are settled. Think of the
cottages out of repair&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang the cottages!&rdquo; cried Vibert. &ldquo;Leave
them alone, and they&rsquo;ll tumble down of their own
accord. Why should we trouble ourselves about
them?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We must care for the tenants that live in them,&rdquo;
observed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve never done anything for us, why should
we do anything for them?&rdquo; said Vibert. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe that half of them ever think of paying their
rents. If I were master here,&rdquo; continued Vibert,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d make a law that no dirty, ragged creature
should come within a mile of the house. If these
folk are miserable, I&rsquo;m sorry for it; but that&rsquo;s no
reason why I should be miserable too. Charity
begins at home, and the first thing to be done at
Myst Court is to put house and garden into tip-top
order,&mdash;buy new carpets and a good billiard-table,
set up a fountain yonder on the lawn (we&rsquo;ll consider
about statues and vases), and then invite Alice and
a merry party of young people down to the place.
We&rsquo;d drive out ghosts to the sound of fiddle and
dancing, and depend upon it, you dear little coward,
we should never again hear a word about Myst
Court being haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Vibert, we must remember our uncle&rsquo;s
warnings,&rdquo; said Emmie, gently laying her hand on
her brother&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Beware of selfishness!</i>&mdash;eh? well, I&rsquo;ll think
about that when I see you <i>conquer mistrust</i>. But
to be gay is my nature, as it is yours to be timid,
and Bruce&rsquo;s to be proud. One cannot alter nature.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can it not be improved?&rdquo; asked Emmie.
&ldquo;Look at your garden,&mdash;it has been left for years
to nature, so bears but a crop of weeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if you are going to moralize, I&rsquo;ll be off!&rdquo;
cried Vibert. &ldquo;I have not tried my new gun yet, and
I expect capital sport. I warrant you that I will
bring home a brace of pheasants to mend our fare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor came down to Wiltshire by an early
train, and was gladly welcomed at Myst Court.
His presence greatly added to the harmony of the
family circle; for his sons seldom exchanged bitter
words when their father&rsquo;s eye was upon them.
Emmie&rsquo;s spirits rose. When the family were
gathered together at the luncheon-table, the young
lady playfully rallied Vibert on his &ldquo;capital sport,&rdquo;
for she had seen him return with an empty bag
from his shooting.</p>

<p>Vibert laughed good-humouredly at his own want
of success. &ldquo;I thought that pheasants and partridges
would be plentiful as blackberries in the
brushwood,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I lighted on no bird more
aristocratic than a crow. I think that there must
be poachers abroad, or perhaps four-footed poachers,
in the shape of those starved, disreputable-looking
cats which come prowling about the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose some of those left by my aunt as a
legacy to her maid,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevor.<span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The legatee does not value the keepsakes,&rdquo; said
Vibert, &ldquo;to judge by the looks of the cats that
crossed my path to-day, sneaking back to their old
quarters as if in search for scraps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Mrs. Jessel live far from here?&rdquo; inquired
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About a mile from Myst Court by the road, but
not half that distance by the path through the
wood,&rdquo; answered Bruce. &ldquo;The house left to her
by Mrs. Myers is a two-storied, shallow building,
standing very near the high-road, and looking like a
Cockney villa that had somehow strayed into the
country, and could not find its way back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the cats have the good taste to prefer the
antique beauties of Myst Court embowered in
woods,&rdquo; said Vibert; &ldquo;and their new mistress has
no objection to their living here at free quarters. I
fired at one of the miserable creatures, out of pure
benevolence, but unhappily missed my mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your shooting is on a par with your driving,&rdquo;
remarked Bruce satirically; &ldquo;but Emmie&rsquo;s pony
came off worse than the cat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not my fault!&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert.
&ldquo;I managed the pony famously, in the dark too, and
over a road expressly contrived to break the springs
of a carriage. I was turning a sharp corner with
consummate skill, when Emmie took it into her<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
head to scream and catch hold of my arm. Of
course, chaise and all went into the ditch, and how
long they might have stayed there I know not, had
not those two men come to our help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know who they were?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Trevor, who had already heard something of the
yesterday&rsquo;s adventure from Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one is called Harper, a strange, weird-looking
old man, with long grizzled hair, and croaking
voice,&rdquo; replied Vibert. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I never set
eyes on him again,&mdash;but he lives just outside our
gate. The other was a very different sort of person,
evidently quite a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you think so?&rdquo; said Emmie, in a tone
suggestive of a doubt on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he is a colonel,&rdquo; cried Vibert; &ldquo;you heard
him say so himself,&mdash;a colonel belonging to the
American army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is easy enough for a man to call himself an
American colonel,&rdquo; said Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it fair to disbelieve a gentleman&rsquo;s
account of himself until one has cause to doubt his
truthfulness,&rdquo; remarked Vibert. &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he
added, glancing at Emmie, &ldquo;Colonel Standish did
tell us rather wonderful stories. You remember that
one of the murdered Red Indian&rsquo;s ghost keeping
watch over buried treasure?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a horrible story,&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so graphically told!&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you hear the tale, papa; but I shall tell it
to great disadvantage. A ghost story must lose all
its thrilling effect when heard at a luncheon-table.
Fancy being interrupted at the crisis by a request
for &lsquo;a little more mutton!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the tale had been told, and the meal concluded,
Vibert went out again with his gun, to seek
better success in the woods which surrounded Myst
Court. The youth was wont to enter eagerly into
any new kind of amusement, but three days were
usually sufficient to make him tired of any pursuit.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor, Emmie, and Bruce went into the
drawing-room together, to talk over future plans.
They had scarcely seated themselves by the table, on
which Bruce had placed some papers of estimates,
when the old-fashioned knocker on the front door
gave a loud announcement that a visitor had come
to the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can have found us out already?&rdquo; said Mr.
Trevor. &ldquo;We are scarcely prepared yet to receive
calls from strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe flung open the drawing-room door, and announced
Colonel Standish.</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s glimpses of the stranger on the preceding
evening had been by such uncertain light, and<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
she had been so unfitted by nervous fear to exercise
her powers of observation, that she would scarcely
have recognized her new acquaintance had not his
name been announced. Colonel Standish was a tall
and rather good-looking man, apparently about thirty
years of age, with large bushy black whiskers, connected
with each other by a well-trimmed beard,
which, like a dark ruff, surrounded the chin. He
was dressed in the height of modern fashion, with
no small amount of jewellery displayed in brilliant
studs, coins and other ornaments dangling from a
handsome gold chain, and rings sparkling on more
than one finger of his large gloveless hand. The
colonel had a martial step, and an air of assurance
which might be mistaken for that of ease. He advanced
at once towards Miss Trevor, shook hands
with her, and in a tone of gallantry inquired whether
she had perfectly recovered from the effects of her
late adventure. Emmie only replied by an inclination
of her head, and at once introduced Colonel
Standish to her father and brother. The stranger
shook them both by the hand, with a familiar heartiness
to which neither of the English gentlemen felt
inclined to respond. Mr. Trevor, however, with
grave courtesy, expressed his obligations to the
colonel for the help which he had afforded on the
preceding night.<span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am only too happy to rush to the rescue whenever
so fair a lady is in peril,&rdquo; cried the colonel,
turning and bowing to Emmie. &ldquo;As for your son,&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t think that it was this son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; interrupted Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must congratulate his father on the uncommon
spirit and pluck shown by the young gentleman
whom I met last night, under circumstances calculated
to try the mettle of the boldest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie and Bruce exchanged glances; the faintest
approach to a smile rose on the lips of each on hearing
such exaggerated praise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for this fair lady, she played the heroine,&rdquo;
continued the colonel, again turning gallantly towards
Emmie, whose smile was exchanged for a blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this vulgar flatterer?&rdquo; thought Mr.
Trevor and Bruce. Emmie took an early opportunity
of gliding out of the room, to which she did not
return till the colonel&rsquo;s visit was ended.</p>

<p>Standish was sufficiently a man of the world to
see that he had overacted his part, and had not
made a favourable impression. Mr. Trevor and his
son became more and more coldly civil. The visitor
took the chief share of the conversation, gave his
anecdotes, and cracked his jokes. The Englishmen
thought his jokes coarse, and his anecdotes of questionable
authenticity. Conversation slackened, and<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
in about half an hour the colonel rose to take his
departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I put up at the White Hart at S&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said he,
as he threw down on the table a card for Vibert.
&ldquo;I find the accommodation fair, very fair, but my
stay in the town is uncertain. I hope that we shall
soon meet again,&rdquo; and the colonel shook the hand of
Mr. Trevor, but a good deal less cordially than he
had done on his first introduction to the father of
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not echo his hope,&rdquo; observed Bruce, as
soon as the visitor had tramped out of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who can this low-bred talkative fellow be?&rdquo; said
Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;It is not difficult for an impostor to
pass himself off as a colonel, when those who would
have proofs of his being so must seek for them at
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I doubt this man&rsquo;s being American at all,&rdquo; observed
Bruce. &ldquo;I did not detect in his speech the
peculiar Yankee accent, though it was interlarded
with Yankee phrases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not encourage this colonel&rsquo;s coming about
the house,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevor, walking up to the window.
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Vibert accompanying him
down the drive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they look hand and glove,&rdquo; added Bruce.
&ldquo;How they are laughing and talking together!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert is young and unsuspicious,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Trevor, as he turned from the window; &ldquo;his generous,
frank disposition lays him peculiarly open to deception.
We must make some inquiries at S&mdash;&mdash;
regarding this Colonel Standish. Your tutor, Mr.
Blair, may know something of the man, and the
character which he bears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not forget to gain what information I can,&rdquo;
said Bruce Trevor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>WORK.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_o.jpg" width="85" height="86" alt="O" class="cap" />
<p class="cap13">On the following Sunday afternoon Emmie
was sitting alone by the drawing-room
window, with a devotional book in her
hand, but her eyes resting on the fading glories of
the woodland landscape, and her thoughts on her
childhood&rsquo;s home, when she was joined by her
brother Bruce.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to find you alone,&rdquo; said Bruce, as he
took a seat by his sister&rsquo;s side; &ldquo;I want to consult
you, I need your help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such words from the lips of the speaker were
gratifying to Emmie; Bruce was ever more ready to
give help than to ask it. Emmie closed her book,
put it down, and was at once all attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been making a little chart of the estate,&rdquo;
said Bruce, unrolling a paper which he placed before
his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are those square marks on it?&rdquo; inquired<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
Emmie, looking with interest at the neatly executed
chart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are cottages,&mdash;some larger, some smaller,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;Those buildings marked in red are
public-houses; those in green are farms. You observe
that there is not a church or a school in the
place; there is not one nearer than S&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;More&rsquo;s the pity!&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you count, you will find that there are eighty-seven
tenements of various kinds, and the dwellers
in them are, of course, all tenants of our father.
Give five individuals to each family, and you have
four hundred and thirty-five souls on this estate,
without a resident clergyman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what can bring so many people around us?&rdquo;
asked Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the dye-works,&rdquo; answered her brother.
&ldquo;They give employment to most of the men who
are not farm-labourers, and, as far as I have ascertained,
to some of the women also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the people are not very poor,&rdquo; observed
Emmie, with a look of relief; for she had been
alarmed at the idea of more than four hundred
beggars being quartered on her father&rsquo;s estate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men in work ought not to be very poor,&rdquo;
said Bruce; &ldquo;but then there are sure to be widows,
sick folk, and some too old for work. Besides this,<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
improvidence, ignorance, and vice always bring
misery in their train, and, from all that I have
heard or seen, the people here are little better than
heathens. The children run about like wild creatures;
there is no one to teach them their duty to
God or to man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that papa may in time set up a school,&rdquo;
said Emmie.&mdash;Compulsory education was a thing
not yet introduced into England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that he may; but he cannot do so at
present,&rdquo; observed Bruce. &ldquo;I was talking with him
on the subject on our way from church this morning.
Our father&rsquo;s expenses in educating Vibert and myself
are heavy, and if either or both of us go to college
they will be heavier still. Yet for these wretched
tenants something should be done, and at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa intends gradually to repair or rebuild some
of the cottages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am speaking of the people who inhabit the
cottages,&rdquo; interrupted Bruce; &ldquo;the dirty, ignorant,
swearing, lying creatures who are dropping off, year
by year, from misery on this side of the grave to
worse misery beyond it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie looked distressed and perplexed. &ldquo;What
can be done for them?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must, in the first place, know them better,
and so find out how to help them,&rdquo; said Bruce.<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
&ldquo;You are aware that I have little time to spare from
my studies, which it is my duty to prosecute vigorously.
I can give but my Sunday evenings, and
my father is quite willing that on them I should
hold a night-school for boys in our barn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie looked with smiling admiration on her
young brother, about to undertake with characteristic
resolution what she regarded as a Herculean
task. But no trace of a smile lingered on her lips
as Bruce calmly went on,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can thus do something for the boys, but the
care of the women and the girls naturally falls
upon you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon me!&rdquo; cried Emmie, looking aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Visiting the poor,&rdquo; continued Bruce, &ldquo;is not a
kind of business which our father can undertake;
he has been accustomed to office-work all his life,
and, as he told me to-day, he cannot begin at his
age an occupation which is to him so utterly new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be utterly new to me, and I dare not
attempt cottage-visiting!&rdquo; cried Emmie, whose
benevolent efforts had hitherto been confined to
subscribing to charities or missions, and working
delicate trifles to be sold at fancy bazaars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are young, dear,&rdquo; observed Bruce Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is just the reason why I should not
be sent amongst all those dreadful people!&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
Emmie. &ldquo;I might meet with rudeness, or drunkenness,
or infectious cases. I cannot think how you
could ever wish me to undertake such a work!
Wait till I am forty or fifty years old before you
ask me to visit these poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;children
are growing up ignorant of the very first truths of
religion; wretched women, who know no joy in this
world, see no prospect of peace in another; the sick
lack medicine, the hungry, food; the widow has
no one to comfort her, and the dying&mdash;die without
hope!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie clasped her hands, and looked pleadingly
into the face of her brother. &ldquo;Oh! what do you
ask me to do?&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;do you want me
to visit all these cottages, and the public-houses as
well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all the cottages, and most certainly not
the public-houses,&rdquo; answered Bruce with a smile.
&ldquo;See,&rdquo; he continued, pointing to different parts of
his chart, &ldquo;I have marked with an E those
dwellings which I thought that a lady might visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are a fearful number of E&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said poor
Emmie, very gravely surveying the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, if you took but two cottages each day
(that would be scarce half-an-hour&rsquo;s work), in a
month you would have visited all that I have<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
marked for you,&rdquo; said the methodical Bruce; &ldquo;and
in each you would have left some little book or
striking tract, if you had found that the inmates
could read.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be afraid to ask them if they could
read or not,&rdquo; cried Emmie. Bruce went on without
heeding the interruption.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would keep a book, and mark down each
day where you had called, with a slight notice of the
state of each cottage, the name of its tenant, the
number of the children, and such other particulars
as would be of the utmost value to our father when
he affords relief in money. It would be better,
perhaps, for you to make it a rule not to give
money yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is just the only thing that I could do!&rdquo;
exclaimed Emmie; &ldquo;I dare not intrude into cottage
homes without the excuse of coming to give charity
to those who want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The visits of a lady would not be deemed an
intrusion,&rdquo; said Bruce. He had some practical
knowledge on the subject, having been for years at
a private school where the ladies of the master&rsquo;s
family constantly visited the poor. &ldquo;Your gentle
courtesy will make you welcome wherever you go.
Nor need you go alone, you can always take Susan
with you.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not let Susan go by herself?&rdquo; said
Emmie, grasping eagerly at an idea which afforded
a hope of escape from work which she disliked and
dreaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan has been trained for a lady&rsquo;s-maid, and
not for a Bible-woman,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;she is not
fitted to act as your substitute, useful as she may
prove as your helper. Nor would Susan be as
readily welcomed amongst our tenants as would be
a real lady, their landlord&rsquo;s only daughter. Your
position and education, Emmie, give you advantages
which Susan would not possess; they are talents
intrusted to you, which it would be a sin to bury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie heaved a disconsolate sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me put the subject in a clearer light,&rdquo; pursued
Bruce. &ldquo;What would you call the conduct of
one of your servants who should, without your leave,
ask another person to do the work which she herself
had been engaged to perform?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should call it indolence,&rdquo; replied Emmie. Her
brother added the word &ldquo;presumption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if a soldier on the eve of a battle should
hire a substitute to fight in his stead,&rdquo; continued
Bruce, &ldquo;what would such an act appear to his
comrades and captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cowardice,&rdquo; answered Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been instances,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;of<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
pilgrimages and penances, imposed on the wealthy,
<i>being performed by proxy!</i> A poor man endured,
for the sake of money, what the rich man believed
to be the penalty of his own sins. What were
such penances or pilgrimages, Emmie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mockery,&rdquo; was the faltered reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if in man&rsquo;s sight there are duties which
we cannot make over to others without presumption,
cowardice, and rendering the performance of them a
solemn mockery, think you that the Divine Master
looks with favour on services done <i>by proxy?</i> He
intends the rich to come in contact with their poorer
brethren. He claims from us not merely the money
which we can easily give, but the words of our lips,
the strength of our limbs, the thoughts of our
brains, the time which is far more precious than
gold. The work which your Master gives you to
do, the special work, no substitute can perform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I wish with all my heart and soul that
we had never left Summer Villa, never come to
Myst Hall!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie.</p>

<p>Bruce was a little disappointed that such an exclamation
should be the only reply to his serious
words. &ldquo;You would surely not desire to pass
through life putting aside every cross but the fanciful
ornament which it is the fashion to wear!&rdquo; he
remarked with slight severity in his manner. &ldquo;You<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
have given yourself, body and soul, to a heavenly
Master,&mdash;is it for Him or for you to choose your
work? Is it a very hard command if He say
to you now, &lsquo;Work for one half-hour each day in
My vineyard&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather work for six hours with my
fingers quietly in my own room,&rdquo; murmured Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, you would select your own favourite
kind of work, take merely what is pleasant and
easy, and what suits your natural temper,&rdquo; said
Bruce. &ldquo;There is nothing to thwart your will or
try your temper in making pretty trifles, cultivating
your accomplishments, or managing a small household
such as ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken, Bruce,&rdquo; observed Emmie,
raising her head, which had drooped as she
had uttered her former sentence. &ldquo;It does try my
courage to speak to our new servant Hannah, that
masculine, loud-voiced, ill-tempered woman. I did
but say to her this morning, in as gentle a way as I
could, that I have a book of recipes, and that perhaps
she could get some hints from it, as one of
the gentlemen is rather particular as to cookery,
and Hannah looked ready to fly at my face. I
shall never venture to find fault with her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie, Emmie, is this miserable timidity to
meet you at every turn?&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce. &ldquo;Have<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
you no spirit, no strength of will to wrestle it down,
to rise above it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot help being timid,&rdquo; sighed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert might as well say that he cannot help
being selfish,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;If you know that you
have a besetting fault, it is not that you should sit
down with folded hands and let it bind you, without
so much as a struggle to shake yourself free.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce spoke with some warmth, for he spoke
from his heart. It is so easy to point out what is
the plain duty of others; it is so difficult frankly
to acknowledge our own. The young man justly
accused Emmie of neglecting the special work appointed
for her by her Great Master, and of shrinking
from fighting the good fight of faith. Himself
resolute and courageous, with great power of self-control
and self-denial, Bruce could make little
allowance for failings which were not his own.
But had Bruce no special work to do from which
the natural man recoiled? had he no battle to fight
against a besetting sin? Bruce&rsquo;s appointed work
lay close to him, though he did not choose to perceive
it, and was virtually repeating Cain&rsquo;s question,
<i>Am I my brother&rsquo;s keeper?</i> Bruce suffered pride to
control his actions, and mar the work of grace in
his soul. It would have been as arduous a work
for him to &ldquo;wrestle it down, to rise above it,&rdquo; as it<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
would have been to his timid sister to go forth and
minister to the poor in the hovels surrounding Myst
Court.</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s conscience was tender; she had a sincere
desire to do what was right, blended with a natural
wish to stand well in the opinion of a brother whom
she admired and loved. Before the interview between
them was ended, Emmie had promised to
&ldquo;attempt to break the ice&rdquo; on the following day;
but she inwardly shivered at the thought of the
effort before her. How many have experienced
this repugnance, this dread of obeying the Master&rsquo;s
call and entering His vineyard!&mdash;how many of
those who have afterwards found in His work their
joy and delight! Duty often, when viewed from a
distance, wears an aspect forbidding and stern; but
on closer approach she is found to have treasures in
her hand, and flowers spring up in her path.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>EARLY IMPRESSIONS.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_v.jpg" width="85" height="86" alt="V" class="cap" />
<p class="cap12">Vibert had not finished his breakfast when
Bruce, on the Monday morning, started
on his walk to the town. Notwithstanding
sundry remonstrances and hints from his father
and Emmie, it was a full half-hour before the
younger brother followed in the track of the elder.
And very different was the careless, sauntering step
of Vibert from the firm, quick tread of Bruce.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Trevor&rsquo;s elder son returned alone in the
dusk of evening, but this time Vibert was scarcely
ten minutes behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Blair has a capital method of imparting
knowledge; it will be our own fault if we do not
make progress under him,&rdquo; said Bruce to Emmie
when he rejoined her in the drawing-room. &ldquo;My
tutor has given me plenty of work to do this
evening, but I must spare an hour to refresh myself
by hearing you sing. And you, dear, what<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
have you been doing during my absence, and where
have you been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce was a little curious to know whether his
fair sister had had courage to &ldquo;break the ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I do not know what you will think of me,
Bruce,&rdquo; said Emmie, dropping her soft brown eyes.
&ldquo;I did intend to make a beginning of visiting the
tenants; I had ruled lines in a book, that I might
set down in order their names and all that you
want to know; but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear all about it,&rdquo; said Bruce good-humouredly,
taking a seat by his sister&rsquo;s side: it
was pleasant to the student to unbend after the
hard work of the day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not go out in the morning,&mdash;that is to
say, not conveniently,&rdquo; began Emmie. &ldquo;I had a
long, long letter to write to Alice, and another to my
aunt in Grosvenor Square; and I had orders to give
to Hannah, and then to arrange with Susan about
hanging pictures to adorn, or rather to hide the untidy
walls of my own little room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be far better to give up that room,&rdquo;
said Bruce. &ldquo;You do not consider, Emmie, in what
a bad position you put me by obliging me to occupy
the other apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; cried Emmie,
looking up with an expression of uneasiness on her<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
face; &ldquo;you do not find that you are disturbed
by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not by spectres,&rdquo; replied Bruce, smiling; &ldquo;but
no one likes to appear to be the most selfish fellow
in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one would ever think you selfish, dear Bruce;
the cap does not fit you at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore I have an objection to putting it on,&rdquo;
said Bruce Trevor; &ldquo;I would leave the cap to
Vibert, who, to judge by his conduct, may actually
think it becoming. But enough of this. You know
that I dislike retaining my luxurious quarters, but
if you really prefer the small room, everything
possible must be done to make it a gem of a room.
Now tell me how you passed the rest of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After luncheon papa called me to his study to
copy out something for him,&rdquo; said Emmie; &ldquo;however,
that did not take me long. Then I glanced
over the <i>Times</i>, and read about such a horrible
murder, committed in a country lane, that it made
me feel more than ever afraid to venture beyond our
grounds. Yet, to please you, dear Bruce, I rang
the bell for Susan, and bade her get ready to accompany
me in a walk to the hamlet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you had a higher motive than that
of pleasing me,&rdquo; said her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not sure that I had, at least not then,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
replied the truthful Emmie. &ldquo;But, whatever my
motive might be, it took Susan and me along the
shrubbery as far as the entrance gate. At the further
side of that gate, looking through the iron bars,
as it seemed to me&mdash;like a bird of prey on the
watch, stood Harper, with his beak-like nose, his
hollow eyes, and his long shaggy hair. You know
whom I mean, he is the strange old man whom we
met on the night of the storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who did good service by cutting the pony&rsquo;s
traces,&rdquo; said Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that I felt more grateful to him for it,&rdquo;
observed Miss Trevor; &ldquo;but I cannot without nervous
dread think of Harper as I saw him on Friday
night, with the gleam of blue lightning on his
strange face and his flashing knife. Then he gave
me such dreadful hints and warnings regarding the
haunted room in Myst Court,&mdash;I shudder whenever
I think of them now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cast them from your mind, they are rubbish,&rdquo;
said Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As Susan and I advanced to the gate,&rdquo; resumed
Emmie, &ldquo;I felt sure that Harper was sharply watching
our movements. I hoped that he would soon
go away, so, turning aside, I took three or four turns
in the wood with Susan; but every time that we
again approached the entrance, I saw that Harper was<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
there. I so much disliked having to pass him, I so
much feared that he would address me, that at last
I gave up my intention of going to the hamlet
to-day. I told Susan that the air felt damp and
cold, and that I should put off paying my visits.
So feeling, I must own, rather ashamed of myself,
I returned to the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is too absurd!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce, a little
provoked, and yet at the same time amused by the
frank confession of Emmie. &ldquo;The hovel in which
lives that man Harper is just outside the gate, so
that if you are afraid of passing him, even when
you have the trusty Susan to act as a bodyguard,
you may as well consider yourself a state prisoner
at once. So nothing was done to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wrote to London for two packets of Partridge&rsquo;s
illustrated fly-leaves,&rdquo; said Emmie. &ldquo;Uncle Arrows
recommended them to me as very attractive and
useful, and suited for cottage homes. I shall not
attempt visiting until I receive the packets by
post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have forestalled you,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;and have
laid in already a fair stock of such ammunition to
serve us in our warfare against ignorance and intemperance
here. I can supply you at once with as
many of the fly-leaves as there are homes in the
hamlet.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I am not to have a day&rsquo;s reprieve,&rdquo; sighed
the unwilling recruit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a duty is before us, the sooner it is done
the better,&rdquo; observed Bruce; &ldquo;repugnance towards
it only grows by delay. And I would advise you,
dear Emmie, should you meet either of those men
whose acquaintance you made in the storm, to be
courteous&mdash;that you always are&mdash;but to avoid
entering into conversation with them, especially
with the so-called American colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, have you learned anything more about
him?&rdquo; inquired Emmie with interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made inquiries regarding him of Mr. Blair, as
my father desired me to do,&rdquo; replied Bruce. &ldquo;I
find that this Standish has been for some weeks at
S&mdash;&mdash;; but where he comes from, why he came,
and wherefore he remains in the place, nobody seems
to know. He has had no introduction, as far as
my tutor is aware, to any of the county families;
but he has, it is said, been seen more than once
quitting the small house which our great-aunt bequeathed
to Mrs. Jessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have taken him there?&rdquo; cried Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My tutor could throw no light on that subject,
and told me that he spoke from mere hearsay, and put
little faith in such gossip. One thing, however, is
certain,&mdash;this colonel lives at the best hotel in the<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
town, and in most luxurious style. He spares himself
no indulgence, hires his hunter and follows the
hounds, or drives about the country in a curricle
and pair, and seems to be rolling in wealth. He is
never seen in a place of worship, and, pushing as he
is, has not made his way into any respectable circle.
The less we have to say to this pseudo-colonel the
better; I suspect him to be a charlatan and impostor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s charity for you, and gratitude!&rdquo; exclaimed
Vibert, who, entering the room while Bruce
was speaking, had heard his concluding sentence.
&ldquo;Here is a gentleman who came to our aid when
we were in a dilemma, who has shown us courtesy
and kindness, and he is to be condemned, unheard,
as an impostor, because a pedant, who has never
put foot in stirrup or fired a shot in his life, cannot
understand a frank, bold, chivalrous nature. Blair
thinks that all must be evil that does not just square
with his old-fashioned notions. Emmie, you should
stand up for your friend,&rdquo; added the youth more
playfully, as he threw himself on an arm-chair, and
stretched himself, after what he considered to be a
long and tiresome walk, &ldquo;for the colonel not only
helped to pull you out of your ditch, but he told
me that my sister is the prettiest girl that he has
seen on this side of the big fish-pond.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you do not encourage such impertinence,&rdquo;
observed Bruce sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if the colonel dare to hint that my brother
is the pleasantest fellow that he has met with, I&rsquo;ll
resent the impertinence, I promise you,&rdquo; laughed
Vibert.</p>

<p>Emmie foresaw, with uneasiness, more angry
sparring between her two brothers, and, to turn the
current of conversation, asked Vibert what he
thought of the Blairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, our tutor is a learned professor, who has
pored over books, and puzzled over problems, till he
has grown into the shape of a note of interrogation,&rdquo;
replied Vibert lightly. &ldquo;As for his wife, she&rsquo;s a
homely body, as clever men&rsquo;s wives usually are;
Mrs. Blair looks like a housekeeper, but has not the
merit of being a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce, whom the conversation did not greatly
interest, had taken up a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her family?&rdquo; inquired Emmie; &ldquo;I suppose
that you have made their acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were all gathered together at early dinner,
if one could call that a dinner at which there was
nothing eatable,&rdquo; said the fastidious Vibert. &ldquo;There
was old Blair at one end of the table, hacking at a
shoulder of mutton, and talking, as he did so, to
Bruce about Sophocles and Euripides. There was<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
Mrs. Blair at the other end, ladling out the potatoes.
Bruce and I sat on one side, and three demure little
chaps in pinafores on the other, like degrees of comparison,
small, smaller, and smallest; dull, duller,
and dullest. The children were so terribly well-behaved,
that they never asked for anything (not
that there was much to ask for), they never spoke
a word, nor lifted their eyes from their plates, but
wielded with propriety their forks and spoons; I
think that only the eldest of the three was trusted
with a knife. The little fellows&rsquo; looks seemed to
say, &lsquo;It is a matter of business, and not of play,
to eat shoulder of mutton and boiled rice pudding,
and drink water out of horn mugs.&rsquo; The whole
affair had such a nursery look about it, that I half
expected to be provided with a pinafore, instead of
a dinner napkin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You incorrigible boy!&rdquo; laughed Emmie; &ldquo;I
think that the three degrees of comparison will
become merry, merrier, and merriest in your company
soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will have precious little of it, I can tell
you that,&rdquo; said Vibert; &ldquo;one such meal is enough for
me. To say nothing of its intolerable dulness, the
wine of Blair&rsquo;s table is insufferably bad, the mere
washing out of casks, cheap trash!&rdquo;&mdash;the lad distorted
his handsome features into an expression of<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
strong disgust. &ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i> did not mind it, Bruce,&rdquo;
continued Vibert, as his brother glanced up from
his book; &ldquo;you are a water-drinker and no judge on
the subject, but <i>I</i> know what is what, and cheap
wine of all things I detest. It ruins the constitution.
I shall try if I cannot get something eatable
and drinkable in the town; I hear that there is a
capital <i>table d&rsquo;hte</i> at the White Hart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are aware that the arrangement for our
having luncheon at our tutor&rsquo;s being concluded,
your taking the meal elsewhere must involve double
expense,&rdquo; observed Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said the youthful epicurean,
shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t work on coarse
mutton and plain rice pudding, served up on plates
of the old willow-pattern; specially as I seem likely
to be starved at Myst Court, if we are to have no
cook but Hannah. I am certain,&rdquo; continued Vibert,
his bright eyes sparkling with fun as he turned to
his sister&mdash;&ldquo;I am certain that yesterday&rsquo;s boiled
rabbits were my great-aunt&rsquo;s cats in disguise, and
that the soup&mdash;faugh!&mdash;was simply the water in
which they had been boiled! Why did we not
bring our old cook to Myst Court?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not bring her, because she would not
come,&rdquo; replied Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that in an old haunted house, country<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
cooks and country footmen are necessary evils, and
must be endured,&rdquo; said Vibert, attempting to look
philosophic. &ldquo;But I hope that you, as mistress of
the establishment, have spoken pretty sharply to
Hannah. I hope that you have given her a fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hannah is a good deal more likely to give me
one,&rdquo; answered the smiling Emmie. &ldquo;I think of
making over to you, Vibert, the office of scolding
the cook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should find that a more formidable task than
that of facing all the ghosts of Myst Court,&rdquo; was
the merry lad&rsquo;s playful reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>THE FIRST VISIT.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_b1.jpg" width="100" height="86" alt="&quot;B" class="cap" />
<p class="cap15">&ldquo;Bruce is right; whenever a disagreeable
duty is to be done, the sooner we get
over it the better,&rdquo; said Emmie to herself,
as, accompanied by Susan, she started on her
walk before luncheon on the following day. A
cloud of care was on the youthful face which looked
so fair and gentle under the shade of the broad-brimmed
garden-hat which the maiden wore.
Emmie had &ldquo;screwed up her courage to the sticking-point,&rdquo;
and had resolved not to return home
without having performed her self-allotted task of,
at least, entering two of the cottages inhabited by
her father&rsquo;s tenants. The young lady had a couple
of fly-leaves in her hand, with their attractive
pictures outermost,&mdash;these were what Bruce had
called her ammunition; but the timid recruit had a
reserve, on which she counted more, in the form of
a half-crown slipped into her left glove, ready to be<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
produced in a moment. There are many district
visitors who may remember the time when they
started on their first campaign as reluctantly and as
timidly as did the inexperienced Emmie.</p></div>

<p>It may have been observed that the maiden undertook
her work simply as a hard duty. She was
urged onwards by a brother&rsquo;s counsels, and pricked
by the goad of conscience. There was in Miss
Trevor none of the hopeful, earnest spirit which
hears the Master&rsquo;s call, and answers it with the cry,
&ldquo;Here am I; send me!&rdquo; Emmie had indeed
prayed for help in entering on her new sphere, but
her prayer was not the prayer of faith. She did
not realize that God could indeed make her a
channel through which His stream of blessing might
flow on a parched and thirsty land. She did not
believe that her dumb lips might be so opened that
her mouth might show forth His praise. Emmie
had a profound mistrust of her own powers. Such
mistrust is safe and may be salutary; but she
confounded that innocent diffidence with what was
really mistrust of God. The girl knew her own
weakness; so far, all was well; but there was unbelief
in not resting on the almighty strength of
her God. Emmie would have been startled and
shocked had the truth been clothed in words, but
she was really regarding the Most High as a Master<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
who commands that bricks should be made without
giving the needful straw, as a Leader who sends
forth feeble recruits to the fight all unprovided
with armour. The maiden&rsquo;s courage was not sustained
by the thought, <i>I will go in the strength of
the Lord God;</i> nor did she rest on His promise, <i>My
grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made
perfect in weakness.</i> It was not the love of God, but
the dread of incurring His displeasure, which made the
poor, hesitating, unwilling girl combat the fear of man.</p>

<p>And if Emmie was not impelled forwards by a
loving desire to please a loving Master, still less was
she influenced by tender concern for the souls of
those whom she felt that she ought to visit. The
child of luxury, in her pleasant home, had scarcely
regarded the poor as being of the same class of
beings as herself. They were creatures to be pitied,
to be helped, to be taught by those trained for the
work; but as beings to be objects of sympathy and
love, as children of the one Great Father, Emmie
could not regard them. Charity was thus to her
but a cold dry duty, like the timber which may be
shaped into a thousand useful purposes; but not
like the living tree whose branches are bright with
blossoms or rich in fruit, because through it flows
the life-giving sap. Such Christian charity belongs
not to fallen nature; it is a special gift of God, and<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
comes through close union, by faith, with Him whose
nature is love. Emmie&rsquo;s faith was so weak, that it
is no marvel that her prayers for guidance were
little more than forms, and that her compassion for
her poor fellow-sinners was cold. The young Christian
had <i>not</i> conquered mistrust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Susan, have you not told me that the ladies
with whom you once lived used to visit the poor?&rdquo;
said Emmie to her attendant as the two proceeded
along the drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, constantly, miss,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that I knew how they made their way
with the cottagers. Did they not find it very difficult
at first?&rdquo; asked Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know how they found it at first,&rdquo;
replied Susan; &ldquo;for when I entered the service of
the vicar&rsquo;s lady, even her little ones were accustomed
to go to the homes of the poor whom they
knew, to make some good old creature happy with
a jug of warm broth, or a bit of flannel, or, perhaps,
a text in large letters, painted by themselves, to be
hung up in a sick person&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is just the difficult point,&rdquo; observed
Emmie,&mdash;&ldquo;how did the family come to know the
poor so well? If one were once acquainted with
the &lsquo;good old creature,&rsquo; there might be some pleasure
in taking the broth or the flannel.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My young ladies used to go on their regular
rounds, miss, and exchange the books which they
lent to the poor. I have often gone with the
ladies to carry the books,&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;The
visitors were always asked to sit down in the
cottages, the people were so much pleased to see
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when the ladies sat down, what happened
next?&rdquo; asked Emmie, who felt herself to be ignorant
of the very alphabet of district visiting, and
who was not too proud to learn from her maid.
&ldquo;What did your ladies say? Did they begin
directly to teach and to preach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no, miss!&rdquo; cried Susan, a little surprised
at the question; &ldquo;I think that my ladies
talked to the poor much as they would have talked
to other people. They spoke to the cottagers about
their health and the weather, and to the mothers
about their children, and they gave any little bit of
news, perhaps out of a missionary paper, that they
thought would amuse the poor folk. The talking
came all quite natural-like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would never come natural-like with me,&rdquo;
observed Emmie; &ldquo;nor, to own the truth, do I see
that much good is gained by that kind of talk.
One does not make the effort of going into the dirty
homes of the poor just to gossip with them, as one<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
might do with a friend, but to teach them their
duty and make them better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan knew her proper place too well to reply to
this observation of her young mistress; the maid
thought, however, to herself that her former ladies
had found real friends and dear friends too amongst
the poor, and that to form a tie of sympathy between
the higher and lower classes <i>did do good</i>,
even if there were no direct religious teaching.
Susan remembered also that she had heard the most
pious of her young ladies observe that she had herself
learned more from the poor than she had ever
been able to teach them. The district visitor should
recognize the possibility of mutual benefit when she
goes on her charity rounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did your ladies never talk to the people about
their souls?&rdquo; inquired Emmie. &ldquo;Was nothing said
about religion in these visits which they paid to the
poor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, miss,&rdquo; answered Susan, &ldquo;but it came
so natural-like. A blind woman would like to be
read to; then the visitor read from the Bible, and
afterwards the two talked over what had been read.
Or a mother, may be, had lost a baby; and then the
lady would speak of Him who carries the lambs in
His arms. The poor liked to open their hearts to
the ladies and tell them their troubles, because, you<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
see, miss, they felt that the ladies cared. I&rsquo;m sure
when little Amy Fisher died, Miss Mary cried for
her as much as her own mother did. Mrs. Fisher
had been a hard sort of woman,&mdash;I think she was
given to drink,&mdash;but after her little one&rsquo;s death Miss
Mary got her quite round. But all that came quite
natural-like,&rdquo; added Susan, again using her favourite
phrase, by which Emmie understood that there
had been no forced talk on religious subjects, no
hard dogmatical teaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that I could acquire this art of comforting
and helping and sympathizing,&rdquo; thought Emmie;
&ldquo;but I feel sure that I never shall do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie and her maid had now reached the entrance
gate. The young lady was relieved not to
see at it the figure of Harper, whom she regarded
with almost a superstitious dread. She passed his
hovel, a mere tenement of mud, with a thatched
roof, green with moss and stained with yellow
lichen. The door was shut, and no smoke rose
from the single chimney of the dilapidated dwelling.</p>

<p>Picking her way along the muddy road, Emmie,
with a beating heart, proceeded towards the next
cottage, which, though it was far from being neat
and clean in its appearance, had at least glass in
its windows, and was able to stand upright. Her
conversation with Susan had been rather encouraging<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
on the whole to the inexperienced lady visitor.
A faint hope sprang up in the breast of Emmie that
after a while district work might come &ldquo;natural-like&rdquo;
to her as it had done to other ladies. The
fair girl could not but be conscious that she possessed
a more than common power of pleasing, such
a power as might smooth down some of her difficulties
in winning her way to the hearts of the
poor.</p>

<p>Emmie went up to the door of the cottage, hesitated
a moment, murmured to herself, &ldquo;Now for an
effort!&rdquo; and gently tapped with the end of her parasol.
No brief silent prayer was darted up from her
heart,&mdash;that prayer which is as the child&rsquo;s upward
glance at the parent who holds his hand to support
and guide him. When first entering on what she
regarded as work for God, Emmie&rsquo;s thoughts were
not rising to God.</p>

<p>There was a slight stir audible within the cottage
after the lady had knocked, followed by the click
of the latch, and a woman threw open the door.
A scent of bacon, greens, and porter pervaded the
cottage, and Emmie saw that the family were seated
at dinner. A burly-looking man in shirt-sleeves,
whose back had been towards the door, turned
round his unshaven, unwashed face to see who had
tapped for admittance. Several dirty, untidy children<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
stared open-mouthed at the unexpected appearance
of a well-dressed lady. Emmie shrank back,
for with intuitive delicacy she felt that to enter a
cottage at meal-time was an intrusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you step in, miss?&rdquo; said the woman
who had opened the door, with that civility which
is generally met with in the cottage homes of
England.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;not now&mdash;I did not know&mdash;I never
meant&mdash;&rdquo; stammered forth poor Emmie, as nervously
polite as if she had by mistake intruded herself
at the repast of a duchess. The gruff looks of
the man, who did not rise from his chair, took from
the timid girl all self-possession. Emmie expected
him to growl out, &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; And
as the only apology which occurred to her mind for
calling at all, she nervously thrust her half-crown
into the hand of the astonished woman, and with a
muttered &ldquo;I thought you might want it,&rdquo; made her
retreat from the door. Emmie in her confusion
dropped her papers; they were picked up and returned
to her by Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might have left them by the door,&rdquo; observed
Emmie.</p>

<p>Susan thought, though too respectful to say what
she thought, that her young ladies had never <i>dropped</i>
tracts in the mud for the poor to stoop to pick up;<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
the vicar&rsquo;s daughters had always given such papers
with the pleasant smile which had insured for them
a welcome. In distributing religious literature, as
in most other matters, success greatly depends on
the manner in which a thing is done.</p>

<p>Emmie was not satisfied with this her first essay
in cottage-visiting. &ldquo;I never thought of finding
workmen at home,&rdquo; she observed to Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, miss, that twelve is a common dinner-hour,&rdquo;
said Susan, &ldquo;and that then some of the men
come home from their work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then assuredly twelve is a bad visiting hour,&rdquo;
cried Emmie; &ldquo;we had better return home directly.&rdquo;
The young lady walked back to Myst Court at a
much quicker pace than had been hers when she
had started on her little expedition. She was glad
to find herself within the gate and in the shrubbery
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not had much success, but still I can
tell Bruce that I have made a beginning, that I
have broken the ice,&rdquo; thought Emmie. &ldquo;That
woman was civil enough; I should not have much
minded going into the cottage had I chanced to find
her alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Emmie&rsquo;s brothers were, as usual, passing the
day at S&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Trevor was his daughter&rsquo;s only
companion at luncheon. The master of Myst Court<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
was a pleasant, kindly-looking man, who had reached
the shady side of fifty, but with a form yet unbent
and hair but lightly touched with gray. He had
been from youth a steady hard-working man, and
Bruce had probably derived his habits of business
from his father&rsquo;s example. But with Mr. Trevor
the wheel of labour had hitherto run in one groove,
or rather, one may say, on a tramway made smooth
by habit. It had been as natural to Mr. Trevor to
go to his office, as it had been to partake of his
breakfast. The complete change in his mode of life
caused by the removal to Wiltshire, was like the
jarring caused by turning suddenly off the tramway
into a stone-paved road. Mr. Trevor had not been
trained to perform the duties of a landlord and
country squire, and he more than suspected that
what he might have gained in dignity of position
he had lost in comfort. Now as he sat at table in
the lofty dining-room of his stately mansion, Mr.
Trevor&rsquo;s brow wore an expression of worry which
Emmie had never seen upon it when the family
had resided in Summer Villa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look tired, dear papa,&rdquo; she observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had a good deal to annoy me, Emmie,&rdquo;
said her father, who was making very slow progress
indeed with his plateful of beef, tough and not
much more than warmed through. &ldquo;I find that<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
Farmer Vesey has been taking, in a most unscrupulous
manner, a slice off my west field which borders
upon his lands. The steward says that I shall have
to go to law about it. I detest going to law!
Why are not boundaries clearly marked! Then
I&rsquo;ve had endless complaints from the people whose
cottages border the brook below Bullen&rsquo;s dye-works;
they say that the dye kills all the fish, and makes
the water unfit for drinking. Really the complaints
have good foundation. I walked down to-day to
the place, and saw that the water is so discoloured
that I would not let a dog slake his thirst in a
stream so polluted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are the cottagers your tenants, papa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; so it is my business to defend their rights,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;I went at once to Bullen,
hoping that we might come to some satisfactory
arrangement, without having recourse to the lawyers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I hope that you found the manufacturer
open to reason?&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found him to be a low, vulgar, money-making
man, who would not care if he dyed all the rivers
in England scarlet and blue, so that he could fish
his profits out of them. I have heard that Bullen
gives infidel lectures in S&mdash;&mdash;, so that he tries to
poison the springs of knowledge as well as the
waters of the brook.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful man!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have to go to law with him,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor, with a yet more troubled look; &ldquo;I
cannot let my tenants be poisoned, and yet I hate
the worry and expense of a suit. I shall wait
a while, and see if this fellow Bullen will not come
to terms. Then I&rsquo;ve had another annoying thing
brought to my notice this morning: it is certain
that there is poaching on my estate. There has
been no proper care taken to preserve the game
during the time of my predecessor, and if matters
go on in the same way, pheasants will be as rare
here as black swans. Really the cheapest and
easiest way to get game is from a London market!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same reflection had just occurred to Emmie.
Joe, in his noisy way, now entered the room, and
told Miss Trevor, with awkward bluntness, that a
woman was asking to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is her name?&rdquo; inquired Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t give none, miss,&rdquo; said Joe; &ldquo;but
she has brought a lot of children with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Trevor is engaged; desire the woman to
wait a little,&rdquo; said the master of Myst Court.</p>

<p>Joe went out, banging the door behind him, but
in less than three minutes returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There be two other women come to see you,
miss,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One says as you told her to call.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I bade no one call,&rdquo; said Emmie. &ldquo;I am sorry,
papa, that you should be thus disturbed at your meal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had better myself see what is the cause of
this irruption of the Goths and Vandals,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor, rising from his seat, and then quitting
the room. Mr. Trevor had scarcely more experience
than his daughter in dealing personally with the
poor, but he felt heavy upon his conscience the
responsibility belonging to the owner of landed
property.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor in a short time returned, looking
grave and somewhat perplexed. &ldquo;How one misses
clergy, and district visitors, and organized societies
in a place like this!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he resumed
his seat at the table. &ldquo;All these women declare
that they are in want, that their husbands are out
of work; and how am I to tell whether this be or
be not the fact? I have given each of the beggars
a trifle, and told them not to come here again, that
we will make inquiries about them. I cannot have
my door thus besieged. I wonder what brought on
us this sudden invasion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that it was my unlucky half-crown,&rdquo;
observed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom did you give a half-crown?&rdquo; asked
her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gave it at the first cottage to the left of the<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
gate, beyond Harper&rsquo;s wretched little den,&rdquo; replied
Emmie. She read something very unlike approbation
in the eyes of her parent, and shrank from
their questioning gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! you gave it at the cottage of Blunt, the
man who earns higher wages than almost any one
else in the place!&rdquo; cried Mr. Trevor, slightly raising
his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cottage did not look <i>very</i> comfortable,&rdquo;
said Emmie in an apologetic tone. She felt that
the excuse was scarcely sincere, for the comfort or
discomfort of the abode had had little to do with
her giving the money.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the cottage is not comfortable, for the
man Blunt is notoriously given to drinking,&rdquo; said
Mr. Trevor, &ldquo;and doubtless your half-crown is already
turned into gin. You must really exert your
common sense in visiting my tenants, my dear child,&rdquo;
he continued in a tone of vexation, &ldquo;or you will do
incalculable mischief where you intend to do good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so strange a thing to Emmie to receive
anything like reproof from her tender indulgent
parent, that her eyes glistened with tears of distress
and mortification. Mr. Trevor could not bear to
give her pain, and instantly softened his tone to
that of kindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had the best intentions, my darling, and<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
we shall all in time understand our new duties
better. But you must be a little more careful in
future where you visit, and how you give alms. I
wish that instead of Blunt&rsquo;s cottage you had taken
the one to the right of the gate. A poor respectable
widow lives there; if I recollect rightly, her
name is Brant. I have seen her several times at
her cottage-door, looking tidy, but so poor and so ill
that she has been rather upon my mind. It is not
in my way to visit sick women, but I should like
you to call with Susan, and ascertain whether the
poor creature be really in want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa, I will go,&rdquo; said Emmie humbly; &ldquo;I
will this afternoon visit the poor respectable widow,
and try to keep my half-crowns in future for those
who need and deserve them.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1"/>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>TRY AGAIN.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="A" class="cap" />
<p class="cap12">Again Emmie, with her attendant, passed
through the gateway at the entrance to
the grounds of Myst Court. Miss
Trevor had scarcely done so ere she became uncomfortably
conscious that her movements now attracted
a good deal of attention amongst the inmates of the
cottages near. A rabble of children, all dirty and
some of them barefoot, clustered near the gate, and
when the lady had passed it, formed a kind of
volunteer escort with which Emmie would have
gladly dispensed. Some begged, and all stared at
the lady; while two or three urchins, more impudent
than the rest, pressed so closely upon her, that
Susan could scarcely prevent them from impeding
her mistress&rsquo;s progress. Emmie walked fast to rid
herself of her unwelcome companions, but the children
quickened their pace to keep up with the lady.
Women stood at the entrances of their cottages,<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
dropping courtesies, and evidently full of hope that
the dispenser of half-crowns would visit their homes.
Emmie was experimentally learning one of the most
important of lessons for a district visitor, especially
a rich one, that the worst way to begin is to give
money without inquiry, merely to smooth our own
way, and to buy that civility from the poor which
is usually offered freely. The indiscriminating giver
of alms, instead of improving the class whom he
visits, rouses their evil passions. He makes the
poor beggars, if he finds them not beggars already.
Cupidity, jealousy, hypocrisy, these are the seeds
which the careless, indolent almsgiver sows; and
then, when he sees the harvest, he bitterly complains
of the ingratitude which has requited his
generous kindness. To help effectually those who
require help, to sow a blessing and reap a blessing,
we need to receive, we need to ask for the wisdom
that cometh down from above.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that I had flung that unlucky half-crown
into the brook, instead of throwing it away
on those Blunts!&rdquo; thought Emmie. &ldquo;It was my
nervous timidity that made me do so foolish a
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in finding the cottage of
Widow Brant; nor had Emmie even to knock, for
the poor woman stood at her open door, only too<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
glad to welcome the lady in. The widow was
dressed neatly, but very poorly; her mourning was
faded, and many a patch showed the work of
industrious fingers. The inside of the cottage was
so clean, that Emmie felt no reluctance to sit down
on the chair which was offered to her, after a rapid
dusting which it did not seem to require. Mrs.
Brant was a small, thin, sickly-looking woman, with
weak voice and timid manner; not even Emmie
could possibly feel afraid of &ldquo;breaking the ice&rdquo; with
one who excited no feeling but that of compassion.
A good commencement was made; Emmie admired
the flowers in the window, she herself was so fond
of flowers; there was the point of similarity of
taste on which the rich and poor could touch each
other without undue familiarity on the one side, or
sense of condescension on the other. The face of the
widow brightened, and the young visitor felt encouraged.
Miss Trevor went on to make inquiries regarding
the widow&rsquo;s state of health, and listened with
interest unfeigned to the story of long years passed in
weakness and pain. The patient endurance of the
poor invalid interested and touched the heart of her
hearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have you had no medical advice?&rdquo; inquired
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years agone I&rsquo;d the parish doctor, miss; but he<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
didn&rsquo;t do me no good,&rdquo; replied the meek little
widow. &ldquo;But now I&rsquo;m in hopes as I&rsquo;ll soon get
better. There&rsquo;s a wonderful clever man as has
come to this place; they says as he has been in
Ireland, and he has scraped the dust off the tombstones
of saints, and mixed it up with holy water,
and when we&rsquo;ve crossed his palm with a shilling,
miss, he hangs a bag of the dust round our necks,
and mutters a charm to wile away all our pains.
See, miss,&rdquo; and the poor creature showed a small
linen bag fastened round her neck by a morsel of
string, &ldquo;I gave my last shilling for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And has it done you good?&rdquo; asked Emmie, a
little amused at the simplicity of the woman, and
more than a little indignant at the advantage taken
of it by some heartless impostor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as how I feels much better yet,&rdquo;
replied the sufferer, &ldquo;but I hopes as in time the
charm will work a cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will never work anything but disappointment!&rdquo;
cried Miss Trevor; &ldquo;the food which that
shilling might have bought would have done more
for your health than all the charms in the world
made up by a superstitious, ignorant quack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ignorant&mdash;superstitious!&rdquo; croaked out a voice at
the slowly opening door, which made Emmie start
to her feet in alarm. She knew the tones, and she<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
knew the hard features and long grizzled hair of
him who had crossed the threshold, and who now
stood surveying her with a fixed malignant gaze.
&ldquo;Do you talk of <i>ignorance</i>, child,&rdquo; continued
Harper, making a stride towards Emmie, who
instantly backed as far as the narrow space of the
room would admit, &ldquo;you who know not even the
secrets of your own dwelling, nor dare to ask what
things of darkness may haunt it! <i>Superstition!</i>&mdash;if
it be superstition to dread the unseen, to tremble
before the unknown, is it for <i>you</i> to talk of superstition
in another?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie was too much terrified to attempt a reply.
Her one desire was to quit the cottage directly, and
she made a movement as if to do so; but Harper
was between her and the door, and she did not dare
to brush past him. Happily her attendant Susan
was much more self-possessed than was her young
mistress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please to make way for my lady,&rdquo; said the
maid with a decision of manner which caused Harper
to draw a little to one side. Emmie did not
even wait to wish the widow good-day; trembling
like an aspen, the timid girl made her escape from
the cottage, resolved never to run the risk of
encountering Harper again, unless she were under
the immediate protection of her father or Bruce.<span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>Returning rapidly towards the entrance gate, like
one who fears pursuit, Emmie, when almost close to
it, came upon Mrs. Jessel, attired as before in black
dress, with crape-flowers and bugles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Miss Trevor, good afternoon,&rdquo; said the late
attendant on Mrs. Myers, with the mixture of
obsequiousness and forwardness which marked the
manner of one long accustomed to flatter and fawn,
but who felt herself to be now greatly raised in
social position by having a house of her own.
&ldquo;How good you are to go visiting the cottages
round!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot visit in cottages,&rdquo; said poor Emmie
with something like a gasp, as she passed through
the gateway and then stopped, as if she now felt
herself safe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s what my poor dear lady was always
saying, Miss Trevor,&rdquo; observed Jael Jessel, who had
followed her into the grounds. &ldquo;Mrs. Myers was
the kindest of creatures; but she was too nervous
to visit her tenants. &lsquo;You go for me, Jessel,&rsquo; was
always her words; &lsquo;you know every one here, you
know who is sick, and who has had twins, who wants
soup, and who would like a hundred of coals. It
is you that must visit for me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that some one would visit for me!&rdquo;
escaped from the unwary lips of Emmie.<span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;ll do it with all the pleasure in life, miss!&rdquo;
cried Mrs. Jessel, her bugles trembling with the
eagerness with which she clinched what she chose
to regard as an offer of employment. &ldquo;There is
nothing that I like better than looking after the
poor dear folk round about. You see I&rsquo;ve now a
deal of time on my hands. You have only to tell
Hannah, miss, to let me have what goes from your
table, or a drop of broth now and then, and there
shall be no trouble to any one; I&rsquo;ll bring my own
basket to carry the food, and you&rsquo;ll have the satisfaction,
Miss Trevor, of knowing that every one here
is well looked after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said Emmie, who thought
that it would indeed be a comfort to have a substitute
to do the work for which she herself was
proved to be so unfit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just going up to the Court, Miss Trevor,
to hunt after the tabby of which my poor dear lady
was so fond,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Jessel; &ldquo;the creature
misses her so&mdash;every one misses her so! I can&rsquo;t
keep my cats from wandering back to the old house,
where she used to feed them with her own hands.
I&rsquo;ll just tell Hannah your wishes, Miss Trevor, she&rsquo;ll
understand what you want. You&rsquo;d have the cottagers
cared for, and you make over the care of them
all to me.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray take some food at once to poor Mrs.
Brant,&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She shan&rsquo;t go to bed without a good supper,
and I&rsquo;ll tell her who sends it,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Jessel;
&ldquo;meat is the physic she wants. It&rsquo;s not for ladies
like you, Miss Trevor, to be soiling their nice dresses
by going in and out of dirty cottages, and may be
hearing bad language, or meeting, perhaps, with
rudeness. It&rsquo;s for those who are used to the work,
like me; those who know the ins and the outs, the
whys and the wherefores; who are neither easily
taken in, nor easily frightened. Yes, I&rsquo;ll do all
that is wanted,&mdash;you may rest quite easy, Miss
Trevor.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>CARES AND MISTAKES.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="I" class="cap" />
<p class="cap08">If, even while the arrangement with Mrs.
Jessel was thus hastily concluded, Miss
Trevor had her doubts as to whether it
were a wise or a good one, as days and weeks rolled
on the young lady became more certain that a great
mistake had been made. Emmie had given to one
of whose character she knew very little a footing
in the house from which it would not be easy to
displace her. Mrs. Jessel had now a fair excuse for
&ldquo;dropping in&rdquo; at Myst Court at any hour, and she
almost invariably chose the hours after dark. Her
basket, by no means a small one, was Jael&rsquo;s unfailing
companion. Emmie wondered, but never ventured
to inquire, how much of the food which left
Myst Court really found its way to the homes of
the poor. What made Emmie more uneasy were
the words occasionally dropped by her trustworthy
Susan, who evidently disliked Mrs. Jessel&rsquo;s coming<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
so much about the place, and who had no faith in
her qualifications for the office of almoner into which
she had installed herself by taking advantage of
the timidity of Miss Trevor.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Trevor had made it his invariable rule to
pay his bills weekly, and his daughter kept his
household accounts. Emmie was startled at the
amount of the bills now run up by the butcher and
grocer who served the family at Myst Court. The
young lady mustered up courage one day to express
to Hannah her surprise at the heavy expense incurred
at a time when the household was not large,
and there was no entertaining of guests. Hannah
had found out from the first her lady&rsquo;s weakness,
and had laughingly observed to Lizzy, &ldquo;The way
to manage young miss is to flare up at the first
word; she don&rsquo;t dare to bring out a second.&rdquo;
Hannah did not fail to put her tactics into practice
on the present occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by expense, miss,&rdquo;
she growled out, like a surly dog ready to snap;
&ldquo;Mrs. Jessel must have what she wants for the
poor, and it&rsquo;s a lot as her basket holds; one can&rsquo;t
fill it with soap-suds or shavings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie retreated discomfited from the kitchen,
and with a mortified, downcast look carried the
tradesmen&rsquo;s books to her father.<span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Trevor was in his study, writing out a statement
to his lawyer of the wrong inflicted on some
of his tenants by the dye-works of Messrs. Bullen
and Co.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to interrupt you, papa,&rdquo; said Emmie,
as, after gently closing the door behind her, she approached
the table at which her father was seated,
&ldquo;but I am afraid that I shall want more money to
pay these bills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You told me that you had enough,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor, looking up from his writing, with his
ready-dipped pen in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so, till I saw the amount of the bills,&rdquo;
and, as she spoke, Emmie placed the open books on
the desk before her father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is absurd!&rdquo; cried Mr. Trevor, after a rapid
glance at the summings-up; &ldquo;Hannah must either
be dishonest or wasteful. We appear to live at
more expense than we did at Summer Villa, where
we had far more comfort, and had friends to share
our meals. You must speak to Hannah, my
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to her,&rdquo; replied Emmie. &ldquo;Hannah
accounts for the expense by the quantity of
food which Mrs. Jessel takes to the poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that you keep a sharp look-out after
that woman,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevor gravely. &ldquo;It<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
passes my comprehension why you should ever employ
her at all to visit the tenants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie was ashamed to answer what was the
truth,&mdash;&ldquo;I did so because I did not dare to visit
them myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seems to be no end to the drains upon
my purse at present,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevor, leaning
back on his chair; &ldquo;workmen to pay in the house,
fields to drain, county-hospital and schools to assist,
and two law-suits looming before me! Vibert came
to me for more money to-day. How that boy runs
through his allowance! I thought that when he
was beyond reach of London amusements, he would
be able to draw in a little; and, after arranging for
his meals with his tutor, I never expected to have
to pay hotel-bills for my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor had touched on a cause of uneasiness
which was more and more pressing on the spirits of
Emmie. The sister knew, both from light words
dropped by Vibert and grave ones spoken by his
brother, that the youth was by no means giving
due attention to his studies at S&mdash;&mdash;. Vibert was
always late at his tutor&rsquo;s house, never remained
there to luncheon, and not infrequently did not
return for afternoon study at all. Emmie was aware
that Vibert was sometimes driven back from S&mdash;&mdash; in
a curricle by Colonel Standish, arriving at Myst<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
Court long after Bruce had reached the place on
foot. Vibert was enthusiastic in praise of his
American friend, dilating on his talent, his courage,
his generosity,&mdash;perhaps admiring him all the more
from a spirit of opposition to Bruce, who did not
admire him at all.</p>

<p>Emmie saw little of her brothers on week-days,
except at breakfast-time, and during the evenings;
the young lady, therefore, led a somewhat solitary
life. She took occasional drives with her father,
but, except in his company, rarely quitted the
grounds. Time hung very heavily on the fair
maiden&rsquo;s hands; Myst Court was a dreary place in
November to one accustomed to cheerful society,
who had now to pass many hours alone.</p>

<p>Bruce went on steadily with his studies on week-days,
and with his class of boys on Sunday evenings,
learning himself or teaching others with the same
characteristic perseverance and strength of will. He
never again asked Emmie to visit the poor. The
two brothers rarely met each other except at meals,
when the presence of their father prevented unseemly
disputes between them. But both Mr.
Trevor and his daughter were painfully conscious
of the coldness which existed between Vibert and
Bruce. The father was disappointed and displeased
to find that his elder son was not, as the parent<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
had so hoped that he would be,&mdash;a friend, protector,
and guide to the younger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Vibert go on as he is doing, he&rsquo;ll come to
ruin,&rdquo; said Bruce one day to his sister, in the early
part of December, when Emmie was accompanying
him as far as the entrance-gate on his way to
S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruce, I am very, very unhappy about
Vibert,&rdquo; sighed Emmie; &ldquo;I cannot think that he
has a safe companion in that American colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Standish is Vibert&rsquo;s evil genius,&rdquo; muttered
Bruce Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not think that it would be only right
for you to speak seriously to papa about Vibert&rsquo;s
present way of going on?&rdquo; suggested Emmie.</p>

<p>Bruce abruptly stopped short in his walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied emphatically; &ldquo;I will never
say anything again to my father concerning Vibert,
let the boy do what he may. I began to speak last
night on the subject; I began to tell my father what
I thought that he ought to know. I had scarcely
spoken two sentences, when he said coldly&mdash;you
know his manner when he is vexed&mdash;&lsquo;Bruce, you are
jealous of your younger brother.&rsquo; I jealous!&mdash;and of
Vibert!&rdquo; exclaimed Bruce, resuming his walk at a
quick pace which expressed mortification and anger.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the credit that I got for speaking the truth<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
so I mean henceforth to keep silence. Our father is
utterly blind when Vibert is concerned; every one
else must be blamed, rather than a fault be found in
the precious young scapegrace! I may plod on,
study, save, deny myself any indulgence, while
Vibert quaffs his champagne, plays at billiards,&mdash;or
worse, squanders his money and his time; and if
I so much as venture to hint that matters are going
wrong, why I, forsooth, am jealous&mdash;jealous of one
whom I despise&mdash;jealous of a selfish prodigal, who
would sacrifice anything or any one for the sake
of an hour&rsquo;s amusement!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce had reached the iron gate, and he now
flung it wide open with a vehement action, which
was the outward expression of the indignation burning
within his breast. The young man strode forth
from his father&rsquo;s grounds full of that pride of spirit
which is altogether inconsistent with Christian profession.
Yet was Bruce scarcely conscious that he
was proud, because his besetting sin was so closely
shrouded up in his heart&rsquo;s haunted chamber. Bruce
could not accuse himself of being self-righteous, because
he truly acknowledged himself to be a sinner
before his God. He was more free than most young
men in his station from pride of talent, pride of
birth, pride which glories in any personal gift.
Bruce hated ostentation, and was not keenly eager<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
for praise. Where, then, was young Trevor&rsquo;s pride
to be found? It was interwoven in the very fabric
of his character; but so interwoven that it did not
appear glaringly on the surface. Pride, with Bruce,
was as the vein which pervades the marble,&mdash;only
faintly visible here and there, scarcely marring its
beauty, but penetrating deep, yea, to the utmost
depth of the firm and solid mass. If Emmie was
self-indulgent, Vibert self-engrossed, Bruce was pre-eminently
self-willed. His besetting sin was the more
dangerous because it did not startle his conscience.
Bruce knew that his faith in God was steadfast,
his sincerity not to be questioned, that on the path
of duty he walked with a step unswerving and firm.
He compared his own conduct with that of Vibert,
and it was impossible that such a comparison should
not be to the advantage of the elder brother, who
was singularly free from the selfishness which marred
the character of the younger. Yet Bruce was not
safe in his orthodox creed, his stainless life, his useful
labours; he was not walking humbly before his
God. His was not the charity which thinks no
evil, which loves, and hopes, and endures; the scorn
which he felt for a brother&rsquo;s weakness, the anger
roused by a brother&rsquo;s sin, were tokens&mdash;had he
closely examined their source&mdash;of the baneful presence
of pride.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>YES OR NO.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_e1.jpg" width="100" height="85" alt="&quot;E" class="cap" />
<p class="cap14">&ldquo;Everything seems to have gone wrong
with me here!&rdquo; sighed Emmie, as she
sat alone by the drawing-room window,
watching the descent of large flakes of snow,
which melted as they came in contact with earth.
&ldquo;I have been at Myst Court for a month, and what
have I to look back upon since I came here but
feeble attempts to do what is right, melting into
failure, even like those flakes? Yes, my uncle&rsquo;s
warning was not unneeded by me. Fear, the child
of Mistrust, is indeed the haunting spirit that mars
my peace, cripples my usefulness, and takes from
me the power of glorifying God. I am afraid to
rule my own household; I shrink from meeting an
angry look; I wink at what I know to be wrong,&mdash;because
I am too timid to enforce what I know to
be right. I am afraid to enter the dwellings of the
poor, though conscience pricks me whenever I drive<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
past those wretched hovels which it is my duty to
enter as a messenger of mercy and comfort. The
good which I might have done, I do not; and oh! is
it not written, <i>To him that knoweth to do good and
doeth it not, it is sin?</i> I have given up my own
appointed work to a substitute in whom I have
no trust, all through fear&mdash;my mistrustful fear!
Timidity haunts me in my house&mdash;in my family.
I cannot conquer my foolish repugnance even to
drawing back that curtain which divides the right
wing of Myst Court from the more inhabited part
of the dwelling, though my brother every night
passes beyond that curtain to sleep without fear or
harm in that room which I dreaded to enter.
Reason tells me that my misgivings are folly, but
superstitious fear is too strong for reason. And,
though it appear in a different form, is it not the
same mistrust that makes me so fearful to offend
my brothers by speaking, in tender love, truths
which they are unwilling to hear? Vibert, my own
dear Vibert, whom I remember as the bright beautiful
boy who was my mother&rsquo;s darling, the very
sunshine of our home, Vibert has entered, I fear, on
a course that imperils his peace here and his happiness
hereafter. I might exert an elder sister&rsquo;s
influence over his frank and kindly nature; but I
dread to rouse his anger, and risk the loss of his<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
affection. And, alas! I am conscious that the
weakness of character at which Vibert so often has
laughed, has lessened my influence with him for
good. Vibert loves&mdash;but he does not look up to his
sister; on one point, at least, I am in his eyes but
as a silly, unreasoning child!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Emmie possessed, as has been observed, a sensitive
conscience, and was no stranger to the duty of self-examination:
she had made the first step in spiritual
warfare, she had seen and recognized her besetting
foe. But to see and to recognize an enemy is not
the same thing as to fight him. A deeply spiritual
writer has given directions to the Christian soldier in
face of his besetting sin, directions so practical that I
shall quote them instead of giving words of my own.
The writer supposes the presence of the enemy to have
been found out by honest searching of the heart:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the discovery is made, the path of the
spiritual combatant becomes clear, however arduous.
Your fighting is to be no longer a flourishing of the
arms in the air; it is to assume a definite form, it is
to be a combat with the bosom sin. Appropriate
mortifications must be adopted, such as common
sense will suggest, varying with the nature of the
sin, and combined always with a heartfelt acknowledgment
of our utter weakness, and with a silent
but fervent prayer for the grace of Almighty God....<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
What is the warfare of many earnest and well-intentioned
Christians but the sending of shafts at a
venture? They have a certain notion that they
must resist the evil within and without them; but
then this evil presents itself in so many forms that
they are bewildered and confused, and know not
where to begin.... The first work of the politic
spiritual warrior will be to discover his besetting
sin, and having discovered it, to <i>concentrate</i> all his
disposable force before this fortress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let me illustrate the author&rsquo;s meaning by referring
to the characters in my story, whose counterparts
may be found amongst my various readers. Bruce,
being once aware that his bosom sin was pride,
should have taken every opportunity of mortifying
that pride, not only by owning his sins before God,
but by frankly acknowledging his own mistakes and
errors in the presence of men. Vibert, if not by
literal fasting, yet by the practice of self-denial in
every sensual indulgence, should have sought to give
the spirit the victory over the flesh. Emmie, wrestling
down her mistrust by prayer, should have
forced her unwilling spirit to &ldquo;nobly dare the thing
which nature shrinks from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the maiden chose a middle course. She
would not attack the fortress, but go round it; she
would try to do her duty, but rather by evading<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
than by conquering the enemy who opposed her.
Emmie felt like one who has made a pleasant
discovery when a means of reaching her father&rsquo;s
tenants, without trying her own courage, suggested
itself to her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do&mdash;that will do!&rdquo; exclaimed the
maiden, as with a brightening countenance she rose
from her seat, and then crossed the room with light
step to ring the small bell by which she was accustomed
to summon her maid. &ldquo;Christmas-time is
at hand,&mdash;that blessed time when all who have the
power should seek to make those around them
happy. My father and Bruce will, I am sure, approve
of my little plan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie remained standing until Susan entered
the room. Smilingly the young lady confided her
intentions to one who would be her ready assistant
in carrying them out. &ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I mean
to give a feast at Christmas to the younger children
of my father&rsquo;s tenants. We will prepare a German
tree, to be loaded with little gifts, most of them
made up by your hands and mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be delighted to help, miss,&rdquo; said Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine should not merely be a treat for a
day,&rdquo; continued Emmie; &ldquo;I think of something
beyond the mere amusement of the children whom
I invite. Say that fifty little ones come; I would<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
procure fifty New Testaments, that each child might
carry back one to his home, wrapped up in one of
these illustrated fly-leaves with which my brother
has already provided me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those leaves gave Emmie a feeling of shame
whenever her glance chanced to fall on the almost
undiminished packet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that more of the children knew how to
read,&rdquo; observed Susan in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they cannot read, surely most of their parents
can,&rdquo; said Emmie, her wish being father to her
thought. &ldquo;If such good seed be sown broadcast,
certainly some benefit must result. Yes,&rdquo; she continued
cheerfully, &ldquo;I will make friends with the
little children, and through them assist the parents
whose homes I cannot visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the question of ways and means.
Miss Trevor was rather pleased than otherwise to
find that her little project would involve some need
of self-denial. She had five pounds remaining of
her allowance, money which she had intended to
spend in other ways, but which she would devote
to the Christmas treat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not send this,&rdquo; said Emmie, tearing up a
note which she had written to a circulating library
in London; &ldquo;I will do without new books for a
time. Then as for the warm dress which I meant<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
to purchase, your clever fingers, Susan, will make
my present blue cashmere serve me for another
winter in a quiet place like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pleasure of seeing the eyes of fifty children
sparkling with delight at the feast to which she
would invite them, the joy of imparting so much
innocent joy, would, as Emmie truly thought, out-weigh
the small gratification of buying that with
which she so easily could dispense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Susan, bring down my basket of odds
and ends, and&mdash;stay&mdash;you will find pieces of muslin
and ribbon in my left-hand drawer. We must see
what we can make use of in dressing dolls, making
pincushions and needle-books, and devise something
suitable as gifts for the little boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Susan went, and soon returned with a basketful
of such materials as woman&rsquo;s taste and skill can
transform into a thousand attractive forms.</p>

<p>The snow-flakes were falling faster and thicker;
grassy lawn and gravel path were now covered
with a sheet of spotless white, which hid every
roughness and smoothed away every blemish. Emmie
was no longer troubling herself with thoughts
of her follies and failings. With the eagerness
natural to youth, she was preparing for the pleasant
task which she had set herself to perform, a task
which would at the same time employ her fingers,<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
amuse her mind, and quiet her conscience. See her
on her knees on the hearth-rug beside the blazing
fire, with her basket of odds and ends beside her,
and a pile of half-worn-out clothes placed on a chair.
Emmie is sorting and arranging, planning and preparing,
cutting out work for herself and Susan that
will keep them both happily and usefully engaged
for weeks. It is wonderful how care is lightened,
and what mental sunshine comes with occupations
such as this. Emmie&rsquo;s thoughts, instead of brooding
over imaginary terrors, are full of ingenious devices
for improving this and altering that, making
old things look new, and astonishing simple rustics
by elegant trifles such as they never before could
have seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now take up these clothes and look to the
patching,&rdquo; said Emmie, dismissing her maid.&mdash;&ldquo;I
will send at once to London for the Testaments,&rdquo;
she added to herself after Susan had left the apartment.
&ldquo;My five pounds will cover that expense, as
well as the cost of my simple feast,&mdash;tea and cake,
oranges and buns; and then there must be a trifle
for lights for my tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Humming cheerfully to herself, Emmie rose from
her kneeling position and went to her desk, which
lay on the drawing-room table. She unlocked and
opened it, and then took out a pocket-book within<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
which was her five-pound note. Joe was to take
the pony that day to be shod at S&mdash;&mdash;, so Emmie
drew out a form for a money-order for the Bible
Society to be procured at the same time. Emmie,
with the order and bank-note in her hand, was
about to ring the bell for the footman, when Vibert
entered the drawing-room. He looked at the
hearth-rug, strewn with many-coloured scraps and
cuttings from the overflowing basket which Emmie
had been ransacking for materials for her charity work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You here still, Vibert!&rdquo; exclaimed his sister,
pausing with her hand on the old-fashioned bell-rope
which hung by the fire-place. &ldquo;I thought
that you had been for the last hour poring over
your books at S&mdash;&mdash;. Were you afraid of the
snow that you stopped at home this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; echoed Vibert. &ldquo;No; I leave that
word, like bodkins and hair-pins, for the use of the
ladies. The truth is, that I wanted, before I set
off for the town, to ask,&mdash;but what is that which
you have in your hand?&rdquo; asked the youth as his
glance, and an eager glance it was, fell on his sister&rsquo;s
five-pound note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to tell Joe to procure me a money-order,&rdquo;
said Emmie, making a movement to ring
the bell; but a quick sign from Vibert prevented
her from drawing down the heavy bell-rope.<span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, Emmie!&rdquo; cried her brother; &ldquo;you would
do me such a kindness if you were to lend me that
five-pound note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie, for more than one reason, was annoyed
at her brother&rsquo;s request. This was by no means
the first time that Vibert had wanted to borrow
money, and he had a very indifferent memory as
regarded payment of debts. Vibert saw his sister&rsquo;s
look of vexation and the slight frown which for a
moment ruffled the smoothness of her fair brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, darling,&rdquo; he said in a coaxing
manner, &ldquo;that the loan would be a great, a very
great convenience to me. I hate asking papa for
more money; he seems to feel more pinched now
than he did before he came in for a fortune. When
I tell him that I can&rsquo;t manage to keep within my
allowance, he twits me with the prudence and
moderation of Bruce, as if I could skin flints or
count farthings like Bruce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was scorn in the tone of Vibert as he
uttered the last sentence, which roused the spirit of
Emmie in defence of her absent brother. &ldquo;Bruce
is no skin-flint!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;he does many a kind
and generous thing. If he saves, it is on himself;
there is not a particle of selfishness in his nature!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie had not intended to strike at one brother
whilst defending the other; but Vibert was in an<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
excited, irritable mood, and took his sister&rsquo;s words
as a palpable hit at himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the last person from whom I should
have expected such a taunt,&rdquo; said the spendthrift
bitterly. &ldquo;I thought that if I had no other friend
in the world I should find one, Emmie, in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always! always!&rdquo; cried his sister eagerly; &ldquo;I
would do anything for you, dear Vibert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you lend me that five-pound note?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Emmie hesitated and looked vexed. &ldquo;I
had laid it all out already in my mind,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;It is to give pleasure to so many poor children at
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christmas! why, you shall have it back long
before Christmas,&rdquo; cried Vibert; and he held out
his hand for the note. But Emmie retained it still
in her clasp. She was doubtful as to the use which
the young prodigal might make of the money, and
whether it might not be rather an injury than a
kindness to Vibert to replenish his empty purse.</p>

<p>The youth read the doubt on the maiden&rsquo;s expressive
face, and it made him indignant and angry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie, can you not trust me?&rdquo; exclaimed
Vibert in an irritable tone; and, as no answer
immediately came, he passionately repeated the
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh for courage to speak the truth faithfully!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
thought Emmie; but the courage came not with the
wish. Her lips formed a scarcely articulate &ldquo;yes;&rdquo;
and having said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to her brother&rsquo;s question,
she could hardly say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to his demand for a
loan.</p>

<p>Vibert rather took than received the bank-note
from Emmie; he saw that his sister was reluctant
to give it, but he thought that a kiss, and the
assurance that she was &ldquo;the dearest girl in the
world,&rdquo; had set all right between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the money is as safe with me as if it
were in the Bank of England!&rdquo; cried Vibert; &ldquo;you
shall have it back in a week;&rdquo; and nodding good-bye
to Emmie, Vibert quitted the drawing-room,
and was soon on his way to S&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>Emmie watched from the window the light and
graceful form of her brother, as he tramped over the
new-fallen snow, leaving brown footprints behind
him. The poor girl&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears, and
her heart of self-reproach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been no true friend to my thoughtless
young brother,&rdquo; said Emmie to herself; &ldquo;it was
mere selfish cowardice which made me yield to his
wishes, and put in his hands money of which I fear
that he will make no good use.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The maiden left the window, but not to resume
her employment; all her pleasure in it was gone:<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
she had sacrificed her means of doing good to her
fear of offending her brother. Emmie knelt down
on the hearth-rug and hastily gathered up her scraps
of ribbons, chintz, and silk, tossing them back into
the basket, as trash to be thrust out of sight, or
thrown away as useless. The cares which pressed
on Emmie&rsquo;s mind were not now to be banished by
thoughts of Christmas amusements, and the hope of
imparting innocent pleasure to the children of her
father&rsquo;s tenants.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of that day, Miss Trevor took
possession of that apartment which, by means of
thorough repairs, had been prepared for her reception.
It was spacious enough to receive all the furniture
which had been originally placed in the room now
occupied by Bruce. Amongst other articles, the tall
press of richly-carved oak occupied a conspicuous
place; it had been moved with some difficulty from
the position which it had held for two centuries,
and now added to the stateliness, though not perhaps
to the cheerfulness, of Miss Trevor&rsquo;s apartment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>THE ECLIPSE.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The demeanour of Mr. Trevor&rsquo;s two sons,
when they met at the dinner-table on
that evening, was in strong contrast to
each other. Bruce looked grave and stern, and had
the appearance of one who is pale and weary from
too close attention to study. Vibert, on the contrary,
was in the highest spirits.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce, you look as the moon will look to-night
under an eclipse!&rdquo; cried Vibert; &ldquo;you mean to
tack to your name M.A. or D.L. or A.S.S., or
some other mystical letters of the alphabet, and the
shadow of coming distinction is falling on you already!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the night of the eclipse?&rdquo; asked Emmie,
interposing, as was her wont, some indifferent remark
to prevent any interchange of bitter words
between her brothers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; had you forgotten it?&rdquo; said Vibert. &ldquo;It<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
is to be an almost total eclipse. We can hardly see
it from any window in the house, the place is so
smothered with trees; but there is a spot on the
lawn from which we can get a very good view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that we had a telescope here,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I said to my friend Standish,&rdquo;
cried Vibert; &ldquo;for, as you know, I&rsquo;m desperately
eager in pursuit of scientific knowledge. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lend
you mine,&rsquo; said the colonel; &lsquo;it has prodigious
magnifying power. It was my travelling companion
when I journeyed northward, in a sledge, with only
an Eskimo guide, and reached the high latitude of&rsquo;&mdash;I
really don&rsquo;t remember the latitude that Standish
mentioned, but it was something that would make
our Arctic explorers stare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was degree one hundred and one,&rdquo;
said Bruce sarcastically. &ldquo;I suspect that the
colonel&rsquo;s telescope is not with him the only instrument
that has high magnifying power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always sneering at Standish,&rdquo; cried
Vibert angrily; &ldquo;you give him credit for nothing,
simply, I believe, because he has chosen me for his
friend. But others appreciate him better,&rdquo; continued
the youth, addressing his conversation to
Emmie. &ldquo;Standish had grand news to-day from
Washington; he has only been waiting at S&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
till he should know how his suit in America has
prospered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A law-suit?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no; a suit more interesting by far than
any regarding field-boundaries or dye-works!&rdquo;
laughed Vibert. &ldquo;Standish is an illustration of
the proverb, &lsquo;None but the brave deserve the fair.&rsquo;
He has wooed and won the greatest belle in the
West, a cousin of the president of the United States,
a lady with a dowry of half a million of dollars!&rdquo;
Vibert glanced triumphantly at Bruce, and raising
a glass of claret, pledged the health of the colonel&rsquo;s
destined bride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that as the lady is in Washington, the
colonel will not remain long in Wiltshire,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor, who had no wish for his longer stay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst part of the business,&mdash;at least
for me,&rdquo; replied Vibert, setting down the glass, which
he had drained. &ldquo;Standish leaves England almost
directly. He has already secured his passage in an
American steamer, and has only now to get what he
wants to take with him, amongst other things wedding-gifts
for his bride. Standish is prodigiously
liberal as well as enormously rich; so the fair lady will
have her caskets of diamonds and &lsquo;ropes of pearl,&rsquo;
such as a duchess might envy. The colonel asked
me to-day what London jeweller I would recommend,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
continued the youth with a self-complacency
which made his auditors smile, &ldquo;and I told him
that our family had dealt for twenty years with
Messrs. Golding. I showed Standish the watch,
studs, and signet-ring which I had bought at their
shop, and he declared that he had never seen anything
in the jewellery line more tasteful.&rdquo; It was
evident that the boy&rsquo;s vanity had been tickled by
his being consulted on such a matter by one who
was the accepted suitor of a president&rsquo;s cousin.
&ldquo;But here am I talking about these sublunary
affairs, when the eclipse will be beginning,&rdquo; cried
Vibert. &ldquo;It is quarter past seven now,&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced
at his watch as he spoke; &ldquo;the night is splendid,
not a breath of wind is stirring, while moonlight is
silvering the snow. Who will come out with me
and look at the queen of night under a shadow?
Emmie, you will certainly make one of the party;
we all know your taste for the beautiful and sublime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My girl must be well wrapped up if she venture
out in the snow,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll case her in fur like a squirrel!&rdquo; cried
Vibert. &ldquo;Come, Emmie, or we shall be late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie rose from her seat at table; her life at
Myst Court afforded so little variety, that the sight
of an eclipse on a clear wintry night was not one
that she would willingly miss.<span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that you, Bruce, will go too,&rdquo; said
his father. &ldquo;For my part, I have seen so many
lunar eclipses already, that I shall return to my
desk. I want to finish the perusal of that paper
sent by my lawyer which I was showing to you
when the dinner-gong sounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to look over the paper with
you,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I do not care to go out to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man was feeling ill, though he did
not complain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave them to their musty-fusty law; as
for us, we prefer meditation and moonlight!&rdquo; said
Vibert playfully, as a few minutes afterwards he
stood in the hall with Emmie, assisting his sister to
mantle her slight form in her fur-lined mantilla.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why papa should bother himself with
Bullen and his horrible dyes; the stream is clear
enough where it flows through our woods. If
Bullen had poisoned our coffee, or killed our trout,
the matter might have required a lawyer. There
now, just let me throw this pretty little scarlet
shawl over your head, to be a complete defence
against the night air! I declare that it makes you
look like an opening rose-bud; I never saw a headdress
more picturesque and becoming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie smiled, and the brother and sister quitted<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
the house together, sauntering down the steps which
led from the door to the carriage-drive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can see nothing here,&rdquo; observed Vibert; &ldquo;we
must go right round to the back of the house, and
make our way over the lawn, till we get just beyond
the group of yew-trees. There we shall have a clear
view of the moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first touch of shadow was dimming the round
disc of the moon when the brother and sister stepped
forth on the snow. But the orb was hidden from
them, first by the house, and then by the trees
around it, until they should reach the spot indicated
by Vibert. The short quick walk was not a silent
one; Vibert&rsquo;s thoughts were engrossed by a subject
much more interesting to him than the moon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie, I must be off to London to-morrow,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To London!&rdquo; echoed Emmie in surprise.
&ldquo;What has put such a sudden flight into your
mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve many reasons for wishing to go up to town.
Patti is to sing to-morrow night at a grand concert;
I am dying to hear her again, and Standish&mdash;kind
fellow!&mdash;has given me a ticket of admittance. Then
I&rsquo;ve shopping and business to transact which I cannot
possibly put off. I shall only stay for one night
in London, and I will not go to a hotel. Aunt<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
Mary told me, you know, that she could always offer
me a room in Grosvenor Square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Papa will not like the needless expense,&rdquo; began
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expense! how I hate the very word! But you
have smoothed that matter for me, darling,&rdquo; said
Vibert, pressing the arm that was locked in his
own. &ldquo;Papa shall not have a shilling to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you would miss two days of study.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No great loss, if one may judge of what they
would have been by those that have gone before
them,&rdquo; laughed Vibert. &ldquo;I have not fatigued myself
lately by any overwhelming amount of hard
work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear not indeed,&rdquo; said his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll work double when once I&rsquo;ve had my
full swing of pleasure,&rdquo; cried Vibert. &ldquo;I can pass
Bruce, at least in classics, if I make an effort to do
so. I know that I&rsquo;ve been an idle fellow ever
since we came to Myst Court; but when Standish
goes I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do but to study, and I&rsquo;ll
be bound I&rsquo;ll astonish you all with my learning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have only been here for a month,&rdquo; observed
Emmie; &ldquo;it is too early for you to think of returning
to London. You had better far put off
going for a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you that I could not put off!&rdquo; cried<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
Vibert impatiently. &ldquo;My concert ticket will not
keep, nor my business neither. You might as well
tell yon moon to put off her eclipse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the Trevors had reached the spot
beyond the yew-trees, where nothing obstructed
their view of the radiant orb. The dark shadow of
earth was slowly cutting its sharply-defined outline
on her disc, and each minute her clear light was
becoming more and more sensibly obscured. There
is something very solemn in the sight of that natural
phenomenon which science can foretell, but which all
created powers combined can neither prevent nor for
one single moment delay. Even the light gossip of
Vibert was silenced as he gazed. Nothing appeared
to be moving on the snow-covered earth, or through
the still air, save when a bat, with its peculiar flickering
motion, darted between the moon and those
who stood with upraised eyes, silently watching the
deepening eclipse. Behind the trees rose Myst Court,
showing, not its broad stately front, but the back
offices, which were irregular in construction, and
some of them built at a later date than other parts
of the mansion. This side of the house possessed
no beauty whatever by day, save what climbing ivy
might give; but by moonlight its very irregularity
gave to it a picturesque charm which was wanting
to the more handsome but flatter front of the dwelling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
Emmie turned round to glance at a part of
her <a href="#frontispiece">new home</a> with which she was very imperfectly
acquainted, as she had never entered the mansion at
that eastern side. She admired the effect of moonlight
on the snow-covered ivy which mantled the
walls&mdash;silver gleams which threw into strong contrast
the deep black shadows which fell from projecting
gable or overhanging roof. Even the chimneys
seemed transformed into twisted columns of ebony
and silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought that Myst Court could look so
romantic,&rdquo; said Emmie; &ldquo;it was worth while coming
out at night to see it as we see it now. But the
air is chilly,&rdquo; she added, and, to draw her scarlet
shawl closer over her braided hair, the maiden for a
moment drew her arm from that of her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! I had forgotten the telescope!&rdquo; exclaimed
Vibert; and with that want of thought for others
which with him was a branch from the root of
selfishness, the youth darted off to bring the glass,
leaving his sister alone beside the shadowy yew-trees.</p>

<p>Emmie had not thought of fear so long as she
had leaned on her brother&rsquo;s arm, so long as the
lively Vibert was close beside her; but his departure&mdash;so
sudden, that she had no time to cry
&ldquo;Do not go!&rdquo; before he was gone&mdash; awoke her dormant<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
terrors. To find herself in utter solitude,
standing on the snowy lawn beside the gloomy yews,
within bow-shot of a dwelling said to be haunted,
whilst the very moon was suffering eclipse, was a
position which might have tried stronger nerves
than those of Emmie. All the horrible tales that
she had heard on the night of her first arrival, the
colonel&rsquo;s ghastly legends, Jael&rsquo;s stories of apparitions
seen in that very house which now dimly
loomed before the eyes of the maiden, the dark hints
of dangers thrown out by Harper&mdash;all rushed at
once on the mind of the timid girl. She made a
few quick steps in pursuit of Vibert; but he had
vanished from her sight round the corner of the
house. Emmie was afraid to skirt half of the spacious
mansion alone, yet equally afraid to remain in
such dreary solitude, to await her brother&rsquo;s return.
A breeze stirred the branches of neighbouring trees;
Emmie started at the sound of the rustle. The
tall bushes in their shrouds of snow began to her
excited imagination to assume the form of spectres;
Emmie almost fancied that they began to move
towards her! And now&mdash;it is not imagination&mdash;a
dark figure is slowly moving along the gravel-path,
whitened by snow, which divides the lawn on which
Emmie is standing from that back part of Myst
Court to which her gaze is directed! Emmie&rsquo;s first<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
emotion is that of terror, her next is that of relief.
She recognizes the sound of a short dry cough,
which has nothing unearthly about it; and by the
faint light of the half-eclipsed moon sees the outline
of a familiar form most unlike the shape in which a
spectre might be supposed to appear. Emmie feels
no longer alone. There is Mrs. Jessel, coming at
no unwonted hour, with basket on arm, doubtless
to carry away what may remain of the evening&rsquo;s
repast.</p>

<p>Never before had Emmie so welcomed the appearance
of Mrs. Myer&rsquo;s late attendant, the obsequious,
voluble Jael. Lightly the young-lady tripped over
the soft white snow, whilst Mrs. Jessel was engaged
in opening some back-door which lay in the deepest
shadow behind a projecting part of the building.
Emmie&rsquo;s step was noiseless as that of a fairy, and
her form was unseen by Mrs. Jessel, whose back was
turned towards her. Jael turned a key, pushed
open a door, and entered the house, leaving the door
ajar. Emmie followed the woman into the dwelling,
guided by the sound of her creaking boots and
her short dry cough. The passage which the two
had entered was dark, but Emmie naturally expected
that some inner door would quickly be
opened, and that she should find herself in the light
and warmth of her own kitchen, for whose cheerful<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
interior Mrs. Jessel of course was bound. How
welcome to the ears of Emmie would be even the
coarse loud tones of Hannah! The young lady was
somewhat surprised when the footsteps which she
was following led up a narrow staircase, instead of
turning towards what she supposed to be the direction
of the kitchen. Still, as it was certain that Jael, after
living for years in the mansion, must be acquainted
with its every turn and winding, and as it was
equally certain that she must be going to some
lighted part, Miss Trevor went on, feeling her way
by the iron railing up the narrow stone stair, listening
to the creak of the boots and the occasional
cough, which told that her guide was in front.
Emmie felt a strange repugnance to address Mrs.
Jessel in the darkness, therefore groped on her way
in silence, expecting every moment to be ushered into
the light. Here we leave her for the present, and
go for a while to the study of Mr. Trevor, where he
and his elder son are quietly engaged with the lawyer&rsquo;s
papers.</p>

<img src="images/drop_i1.jpg" width="100" height="87" alt="&quot;I" class="cap" />
<p class="cap12">&ldquo;It strikes me that there are unusual
sounds in this generally quiet house,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Trevor, raising his head
to listen, after he and Bruce had been for nearly
half-an-hour employed in reading and making extracts.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;I have been noticing them too,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I
suppose that Vibert is in one of his wild merry
moods, and that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ere he could finish his sentence, the door of the
study was suddenly flung wide open, and Vibert
rushed in, with anxiety painted on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie&mdash;is she with you?&rdquo; he breathlessly
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Trevor, rising in sudden
alarm. Bruce dropped the paper which he had held
in his hand, and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did she not go with you to watch the eclipse?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
asked the father; &ldquo;when did you miss her?&mdash;where
did you leave her?&rdquo; The questions were asked in
a manner and tone that expressed anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I left Emmie on the sward by the yew-trees,&rdquo;
said Vibert, answering the last question first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely not alone?&rdquo; interrupted his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was back in three minutes, but she was gone.
I called&mdash;loudly enough&mdash;but there was no answer!
I rushed back to the house, and have since been
hunting all over the place&mdash;upper rooms, lower
rooms, kitchen, and all! The servants know nothing
about Emmie, but are looking for her in every
corner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grounds must be searched with torches
without a moment&rsquo;s delay,&rdquo; cried the father, loudly
ringing the bell of the study. Bruce hurried to the
door with such anxious haste that he almost came
into collision with&mdash;Emmie!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she comes herself, our wandering fairy, to
give an account of her doings!&rdquo; he cried, drawing
back to let Emmie pass him and enter the lighted
apartment. &ldquo;She has only been playing at hide-and-seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce spoke gaily, but almost before the last
word had left his lips his manner changed, for he
looked on his sister, and saw at a glance that no
mirthful frolic had caused her late disappearance.<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
Had the poor heroine of the story of the oaken-chest
contrived by some superhuman effort to burst her
living tomb, even in such ghastly guise might she
have appeared before her wondering friends.</p>

<p>Emmie had entered the study with rapid steps;
she now threw herself into the arms of her father,
and buried her face on his breast, as if seeking for
protection and safety. The poor girl uttered no
sound, but her bosom heaved convulsively, and her
clinging hands trembled as if with ague. Emmie&rsquo;s
scarlet shawl had fallen back on her shoulders, and
over it flowed her dishevelled hair. Emmie&rsquo;s attitude
was so expressive of terror, that she might have
been deemed some fugitive who had barely escaped
with life from some scene of slaughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My child&mdash;my sweet child&mdash;what ails you?
what has happened to alarm you thus?&rdquo; said Mr.
Trevor soothingly, while Bruce dismissed the servants,
who had, in a body, answered the summons of
the bell, only bidding Susan bring a glass of cold
water. &ldquo;Emmie has merely had some little fright,&rdquo;
he said to himself, as he returned to the table.</p>

<p>But that the fright had been no little one was
but too evident when Emmie raised her head, and
turned her face to the light. Her countenance was
colourless, even to the lips, and ghastly as that of a
corpse, whilst her eyes stared wildly, with the pupils<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
dilated, as if seeking some object of terror. Mr.
Trevor made his daughter sit down close by his side,
and put his arm fondly around her, whilst with his
left hand he gently stroked and chafed Emmie&rsquo;s
icy-cold fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor little trembling dove, what has frightened
you so?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s lip quivered, but she was unable to
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m monstrously sorry that I left
you for a moment!&rdquo; cried Vibert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a thoughtless
fellow, I own; but no harm could possibly have
come to you, if you had quietly remained where you
stood. Where did you hide that I could not find
you? Surely you must have heard me calling your
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie shivered, but gave no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not trouble her with questions now,&rdquo; said
her father; &ldquo;she is in a weak and nervous state,&mdash;but
this will set her right,&rdquo; he added, as he proffered
to Emmie&rsquo;s lips the glass of sal-volatile and
water which had been quickly brought by Susan.</p>

<p>The cordial revived the poor girl; her eyes lost
their wild excited expression, and the lips regained
a more natural hue, though the cheeks remained
very pale. But when Emmie was again questioned
as to what had caused her alarm, she but gasped<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
forth, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t ask!&rdquo; and burst into a fit
of hysterical weeping, which lasted for several
minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She had better go to rest at once,&rdquo; said Mr.
Trevor, when the fit had somewhat subsided; &ldquo;quiet
sleep is what she most wants. We will take her to
her own room; and, Susan, do not quit the side of
my daughter to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Supporting the trembling Emmie, who did not
even turn to bid her brothers good-night, Mr. Trevor
then left the study, followed by Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something strange must have happened,&rdquo; said
Vibert, when the three had left the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see no reason to think so,&rdquo; said Bruce, who
had resumed his seat by the table, and had taken
up again the paper which he had dropped. &ldquo;Emmie&rsquo;s
timidity is like a disease, a kind of waking nightmare,
and it would be as idle to look for external
cause for her terrors as it would be for those experienced
in a bad dream. What could have been
more unreasonable than her dread of occupying a
bright pleasant room, because a gentleman had died
of hydrophobia in the one next to it, and that fifty
years ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with such a good thick wall between the
two apartments,&rdquo; observed Vibert, who was standing
with his back to the fire, &ldquo;so that there is not so<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
much as a key-hole through which ghost or goblin
might creep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say so much,&rdquo; remarked Bruce; &ldquo;there
is a door of communication between the two rooms,
though, by the way, the key-hole does <i>not</i> go right
through it, for it can be opened but on one side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A door of communication!&rdquo; exclaimed Vibert.
&ldquo;I never knew that before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor did I,&rdquo; observed Bruce, &ldquo;until the workmen
from S&mdash;&mdash; had to move in my presence the large
heavy press which had stood in that room for I know
not how many years. As they were dragging it off
to place it in the apartment prepared for poor dear
Emmie, I noticed a key-hole in one of the panels
which had hitherto been covered by the oak press.
When the workmen had departed, I tried whether
the key of the door which opens on the corridor
would fit into this newly-discovered key-hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And did it fit it?&rdquo; inquired Vibert eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; was his brother&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does any one but yourself know the secret of
the door in the panel?&rdquo; asked Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; nor do I care that the servants should
know it, nor Emmie, who is sufficiently nervous
already as to what regards the so-called haunted
chamber. I have hung a large map over that part
of the panel in which is the key-hole; and as the<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
housemaid never ventures to move what I place on
the walls, the fact of there being a door of communication
between the two rooms is not likely to be
discovered even by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with the power to enter at will into the
haunted chamber, had you not the curiosity to tread
the forbidden ground?&rdquo; cried Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I first found that the key fitted the key-hole
in the wall, I turned it, and pushed open the
small panel-door,&rdquo; replied Bruce; &ldquo;but I did not
pass into the bricked-up room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You looked in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But saw nothing, for the place was pitch-dark,&rdquo;
answered Bruce. &ldquo;I only observed that the air was
close, as might be expected when coming from a
chamber from which light and air had been carefully
excluded for the last fifty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you have been a whole month with only
a door between you and the mysterious apartment
to which such strange and thrilling stories belong!&rdquo;
cried Vibert. &ldquo;I suppose that you intend thoroughly
to explore its inmost recess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see no use in so doing,&rdquo; was Bruce&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;As the relation to whose bequest my father owes
the possession of the house so anxiously tried to
ensure that no one should enter that room, it seems
scarcely honourable to take advantage of her ignorance<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
of the existence of that small door in the
panel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! that is a mere romantic scruple,&rdquo; said
Vibert. &ldquo;I could not withstand the temptation to
explore the haunted chamber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a lack of curiosity,&rdquo; observed Bruce
Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or a lack of something else,&rdquo; cried his thoughtless
young brother, in a provokingly satirical tone.</p>

<p>Bruce was in an irritable mood on that evening,
and at no time would have patiently borne what
sounded like an imputation on his personal courage.
Who should dare to taunt him with lack of daring,
or the slightest taint of that superstitious fear which
he scorned even in Emmie?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you cannot speak common sense, you idiot,&rdquo;
Bruce fiercely exclaimed, &ldquo;keep your idle twaddle
for those who may mistake it for wit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How now, boys? what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cried the
loud, angry voice of Mr. Trevor, who, re-entering
the room at that moment, had heard Bruce&rsquo;s passionate
words, and seen his fiery glance at his
brother. &ldquo;Bruce, you forget yourself strangely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce bit his nether lip hard. He would not
bandy words with his father, but still less would his
proud spirit brook such sharp reproof even from a
parent. The young man rose, quitted the study,<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
and with a swelling heart went to his own apartment.
Bruce bitterly, though silently, accused his
father of partiality and injustice; the young man
was blinded by pride to the fact that Mr. Trevor
had had good and sufficient reason for finding fault
with his son&rsquo;s intemperate language.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What caused this quarrel?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Trevor
of Vibert, after Bruce had quitted the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruce is in a huff,&mdash;it is no novelty,&rdquo; replied
Vibert. &ldquo;He thinks that every one is wanting
in common sense but his own oracular self.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor paced up and down the study for
some minutes with a troubled mien and furrowed
brow. He had many things to disturb his mind;
he was seriously grieved at Emmie&rsquo;s hysterical state,
and in the dissension between his sons found a new
cause of perplexing annoyance. Vibert marked his
father&rsquo;s vexation, and characteristically enough managed
to take advantage of it for the furtherance of
his own wishes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to keep out of the bear&rsquo;s way till
he has had his growl out,&rdquo; observed Vibert, watching
his father&rsquo;s countenance as he spoke. &ldquo;I have
lots of things that I want to do in London to-morrow.
I would sleep at Aunt Mary&rsquo;s in Grosvenor Square,
and come back on the following day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The youth had thrown out a feeler, and saw by<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
his father&rsquo;s face that Mr. Trevor would not be likely
to offer violent opposition to the trip upon which his
son&rsquo;s heart was set.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be wanting more money, you young
spendthrift,&rdquo; was Mr. Trevor&rsquo;s remark, but made in
an easy, good-humoured way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I have plenty left,&rdquo; answered Vibert.</p>

<p>The unexpected announcement was an agreeable
surprise to the parent, who was not aware that
Vibert&rsquo;s supply had been borrowed from Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might consult your aunt about Emmie,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Trevor, pausing in his walk, and then
resuming his seat. &ldquo;I am not easy regarding the
health of your sister; Myst Court is too dull for her,
I fear, and its loneliness serves to fill her mind with
idle fancies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I&rsquo;ll tell my aunt all about Emmie,&rdquo;
said Vibert, trying to look as thoughtful and sympathetic
as his pleasure at getting his own way
would permit. &ldquo;It is so much easier to explain all
these delicate matters by speaking than by writing,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will take up my watch to Golding to
be repaired,&rdquo; observed Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;I do not like
to trust one so valuable as mine to conveyance by
post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take it with all the pleasure in life!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
cried Vibert, who would eagerly have undertaken
the charge of all the clocks in the house had they
needed just then a journey to London.</p>

<p>The matter was quickly settled; it was arranged
that Vibert should start by an early train.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lucky chance it was that Bruce should
have barked at me just as papa came in!&rdquo; thought
the triumphant Vibert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off before daylight
to-morrow, or the hard-headed, hard-hearted chap
would find a thousand reasons for not letting me go
after all.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>INDECISION.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_v1.jpg" width="100" height="86" alt="&quot;V" class="cap" />
<p class="cap16">&ldquo;Vibert gone to London,&mdash;and so suddenly!&rdquo;
exclaimed Bruce, when, on the
following morning, he heard from his
father of his brother&rsquo;s early departure. &ldquo;Wherefore
did he go? He did not mention to me a word of
his intention to make the journey.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;You scarcely invite his confidence,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is more money thrown to the dogs,&rdquo; muttered
Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; Vibert has shown more consideration for
my purse than usual,&rdquo; said Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;He has
made no call upon it for this little expedition to
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce looked steadfastly into the face of his father
for several seconds, but not in order to read anything
there. The young man&rsquo;s mind was busy with its
own thoughts; a slight smile came over his lips,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
smile of one who has detected a little plot, and
knows how to foil it. With an inaudible &ldquo;I smell
a rat,&rdquo; Bruce turned and walked up to the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert need no money to carry him to London!
As well might we believe that the train in which he
travels requires no steam,&rdquo; thought Bruce to himself.
&ldquo;I happen to know that his purse was empty
yesterday morning. My belief is that Vibert is in
this house at this moment, or at any rate not further
off than S&mdash;&mdash;. He has some silly practical joke
in his head connected with the haunted chamber,
and means to throw me off my guard by a feigned
absence in London. What folly possessed me to
tell a wild hare-brain like Vibert of the little door in
the panel? But it is no matter; whatever frantic
freak he may have in his head, he at least shall find
me prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie came down to morning prayers looking
very pale, and with the violet tints under her languid
eyes, which were tokens of her having passed a
sleepless night. She presided as usual at the breakfast-table,
but in a dreamy, listless manner, herself
scarcely touching the viands. It was evidently an
effort to the poor girl to join in the conversation,
which her father purposely led to such topics as he
thought might interest his daughter. Mr. Trevor
talked of literature and arts, recounted amusing passages<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
from his own history, and did his best to divert
Emmie&rsquo;s mind, but with little apparent effect. Her
eyes were constantly turned towards her brother
with an anxious, questioning look, until, the morning
meal being concluded, Mr. Trevor, perplexed and
disappointed, left the room to speak to his steward.</p>

<p>Emmie then went up to Bruce, who was about to
start on his daily walk to his tutor&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce, dearest, you look ill,&rdquo; said Emmie, laying
a tremulous hand on the arm of her brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might say the same to you, if it were not
treason to utter anything so uncomplimentary to a
fair lady,&rdquo; observed Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you look ill? Has&mdash;has anything
painful occurred?&rdquo; asked Emmie, in a hurried, nervous
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must act echo again,&rdquo; answered Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, oh, tell me what has happened,&rdquo; urged
his sister, who was not in the slightest degree disposed
to enter into a jest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened, dear Emmie,&rdquo; replied
Bruce more gravely. &ldquo;I have had a little headache
these one or two days; it is of no consequence. You
have not the least occasion to look so miserably
anxious as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the young man&rsquo;s surprise, his sister&rsquo;s eyes
filled and then brimmed over with tears. Emmie<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
leaned her brow against his shoulder, and drops fell
fast on the sleeve of his arm, which she was pressing
with a nervous grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Emmie, what can be the cause of all
this sorrow? What ails you?&rdquo; asked Bruce, grieved
at the sight of distress for which he could not account.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bruce!&rdquo; sobbed Emmie, pressing her
brother&rsquo;s arm yet more closely, &ldquo;promise me&mdash;promise
me&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped short, as if afraid to finish
her sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you have me promise?&rdquo; asked Bruce.</p>

<p>Emmie gave no direct reply, but inquired abruptly,
&ldquo;Have you a bell in your room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her question was a real relief to the mind of
Bruce, as it convinced him that Emmie&rsquo;s misery
arose merely from some fanciful terrors in regard to
the bricked-up apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered gaily, &ldquo;and a gun besides, to
say nothing of poker and tongs, pen-knife, and
razors. If any unpleasant guests were to make
their appearance, they should find me quite ready to
meet them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie was crying no longer, but she looked pale
and anxious as ever; something seemed to be on her
tongue struggling for utterance,&mdash;something which
she was afraid or unable to speak.<span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is time for me to be off,&rdquo; said Bruce, gently
releasing his arm from the clasp of his sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce, stay. Tell me if you would again change
rooms with me,&rdquo; cried Emmie, with a convulsive
effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry that you do not like your new
apartment,&rdquo; said Bruce, slightly knitting his brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do like it,&mdash;it is only too good for me,&rdquo; faltered
poor Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why quit it?&rdquo; asked Bruce, with a little
impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that if you would not mind changing&mdash;&rdquo;
Again Emmie stopped abruptly, without
concluding her sentence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I will change rooms with you if you
really wish it,&rdquo; said Bruce, willing to humour his
sister, but making mental reflections on the fickleness
and unreasonableness of the fair sex, of which Emmie
was the only representative with whom he was well
acquainted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do not wish it,&mdash;no, no,&mdash;not yet, not
yet!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie, betraying terror at the idea
of her brother complying with her request. The
patience of Bruce was fairly exhausted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that you would know your own mind,&rdquo;
he said, with an air of vexation. &ldquo;Really, Emmie,
you should try to overcome these ridiculous fears<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
and fancies. Where is your spirit,&mdash;where is your
faith?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie turned away her head with a shivering
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must send you to London for change of
scene,&rdquo; observed Bruce; &ldquo;a few weeks with Aunt
Mary will drive all these unreasonable terrors out of
your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us all go&mdash;at once&mdash;to-day!&rdquo; exclaimed
Emmie, clasping her hands. &ldquo;Let us all leave this
horrible place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For my father or myself to leave Myst Court at
present is simply impossible,&rdquo; said Bruce, in that
tone of quiet decision which, as Emmie well knew,
expressed a resolution which it was useless for her
to attempt to shake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will not leave you,&mdash;no, no!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;Let us all at least be together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we be in danger from any foe, corporeal or
spiritual, your slender arm and more slender courage
will scarcely avail much for our protection,&rdquo; observed
Bruce, with a smile. He had regained his good-humour,
and sought to rally Emmie out of her fears
by assuming a playful manner.</p>

<p>But the attempt was vain; Emmie only burst
again into a fit of weeping, and hastily quitted the
apartment, brushing past her father, who was just<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
returning to the breakfast-room after his interview
with his steward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am extremely annoyed about Emmie,&rdquo; said
the affectionate parent, addressing himself to Bruce;
&ldquo;I cannot comprehend what has taken such a strange
hold on her mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mere fear, I believe,&rdquo; answered Bruce. &ldquo;She
has never struggled to overcome it, and now in this
gloomy old place it has gained complete mastery
over her reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The mere incident of her having been left alone
on the lawn for a few minutes last night seems
scarcely to account for my child&rsquo;s terror,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;Surely Vibert, thoughtless as he is,
cannot have had the senseless cruelty to play on his
sister&rsquo;s timidity any practical joke.&rdquo; The same idea
had occurred, to Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert is capable of any folly,&rdquo; thought the
elder brother; but after the experience of the preceding
evening, he did not put the thought into
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall keep my girl as close by my side as possible,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Trevor. &ldquo;Perhaps this strange
fit of melancholy may pass off; if not, I must arrange
for her going to Grosvenor Square. Her departure
would leave a sad blank in our little circle
at Christmas-time, but my own gratification must<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
not weigh in the balance against my child&rsquo;s comfort
and health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your faith,&mdash;where is your faith?&rdquo;
moaned poor Emmie, repeating to herself again and
again her brother&rsquo;s question, as she paced up and
down her own apartment, wringing her hands.
&ldquo;Oh, miserable doubt and mistrust! I might once
have met my enemy on the ground of duty, and by
prayer and resolute effort have gained some strength
to meet more serious trials; but I let my fears subdue
me without a struggle to cast them off, and now
I lie prostrate,&mdash;a helpless victim bound in their
chains. Usefulness marred, peace destroyed, a horrible
dread on my mind, a reproving conscience
within my breast, I seem now unable even to pray!
I have let go the Hand that would so gently have
led me; darkness is thick around me; I cannot find
my Heavenly Guide! I dread to keep silent, yet
dare not speak. Oh, that horrible, blasphemous
oath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it is time that the reader should be made acquainted
with the circumstances which led to Emmie&rsquo;s
present state of misery. We will therefore return
to that point in the story where we left the maiden
silently tracking in the darkness the steps of Jael up
the dark and narrow stone stairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>THE HAUNTED CHAMBER.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="85" height="84" alt="E" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">Emmie&rsquo;s light footsteps were unheard by
Mrs. Jessel, probably on account of the
creaking noise made by her own. Had
the form before her been that of Susan, Miss Trevor
would at once have addressed her; but she had a
dislike to entering in the darkness into a conversation
with a woman who had told her so many
ghost stories. Emmie therefore delayed speaking
to Jael until they should both have entered a lighted
apartment.</p></div>

<p>The top of the flight of stone steps was soon
reached; Mrs. Jessel turned the handle of a door, and
on her opening it a light streamed from within, casting
its yellow reflection on the wall by the staircase.
Jael entered the room before her, and Emmie heard
her say, &ldquo;What! at work still?&rdquo; as she passed into
the warmth and light.</p>

<p>Not in the least degree doubting that the woman<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
had addressed one of the household, and eager to
find herself once more amongst familiar faces, out of
the darkness and chilly night air, Emmie quickly
followed Mrs. Jessel into the room. No sooner had
she crossed the threshold than she stopped short in
surprise and alarm, gazing in motionless terror at the
unexpected sight which met her eyes,&mdash;for Emmie
stood in the haunted chamber!</p>

<p>The room was of good size, and, like that which it
adjoined on the side opposite to that by which Jael
had entered, was panelled with oak. The apartment
was warmed by a stove, and lighted by a shaded
lamp, which cast a dull radiance on antique furniture
and various objects of whose nature and use Emmie,
from her hurried glance, could form no definite idea.
Her attention was concentrated on a point close to
that shaded lamp. It stood on a table, and on every
object that lay on that table threw an intense light.
Seated almost close to it, bending over what seemed
like a sheet of copper, with a graving instrument
in his right hand, and a magnifying glass in his left,
his long grizzled hair falling over his brow as he
stooped, Emmie beheld the object of her special
dread, the hollow-eyed, weird-looking Harper!</p>

<p>He raised his head; he saw the unexpected intruder;
his glistening eyes were fixed upon Emmie,
and, like those of the serpent surveying its victim,<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
their gaze seemed to deprive the poor girl of all
power of motion. Emmie, had she not been paralyzed
with fear, would have had time to start back, spring
down the stairs, and rouse the family by her loud
call for assistance. But in the extremity of her
terror the timid girl neither stirred foot nor uttered
cry. She stood, as it were, spell-bound. In a few
seconds her opportunity for flight was lost. Jael,
seeing Harper&rsquo;s look, turned round, beheld Emmie
behind her, and instantly closed and bolted the door.
The poor maiden found herself a helpless prisoner in
one of the rooms of her father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Utter a sound and you die!&rdquo; growled Harper,
dropping his graving instrument, and grasping the
large knife which had been lying open on the table
before him.</p>

<p>Emmie clasped her hands and sank on her
knees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you bring her here?&rdquo; said Harper
fiercely to Jael, adding epithets of abuse with which
I shall not soil my pages.</p>

<p>Jael looked alarmed, and declared that she had
never guessed that the girl was following her up the
secret staircase. &ldquo;And now that she has discovered
your hiding-place, what is to be done?&rdquo; cried the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead men tell no tales,&rdquo; muttered Harper, in a<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
tone which made the blood of Emmie appear to
freeze in her veins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no; you must not harm her,&mdash;you cannot
touch her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Jessel. &ldquo;Such a deed could
never be hidden; you would only ruin us all. Her
father and brothers would search till they found her,
if they had to pull down every brick in the house
with their nails!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harper looked perplexed and undecided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make her promise secrecy, and let her go free,&rdquo;
said Jael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And trust my safety to a woman&rsquo;s power of
holding her tongue! Not I; I will take a surer
way,&mdash;if I swing for it!&rdquo; cried Harper, starting
from his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have listened to your wife&rsquo;s advice before
now, and found it good,&rdquo; said she whom we have
called Mrs. Jessel, interposing herself between her
husband and Emmie. A rapid conversation then
passed between the Harpers, held in a tone so low
that Emmie could not distinguish a word, though
she had a fearful consciousness that on the result of
that conversation her own life must depend. The
terrified girl could not collect her thoughts, even for
prayer, unless the voiceless cry of &ldquo;Mercy, mercy!&rdquo;
which was bursting from her heart, was an appeal
for help from above.<span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>At length her fate was decided. Harper approached
the crouching form of Emmie, and thus addressed
her, still grasping the knife in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take the most solemn oath that tongue
can frame never to give hint, by word or sign, of what
you have seen this night? Will you swear silence
deep as the grave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything&mdash;everything&mdash;I will never betray
you!&rdquo; gasped Emmie, grasping with the eagerness
of a drowning wretch at the hope of safety thus
held out.</p>

<p>Harper made the shuddering girl repeat after him,
word for word, an oath of his own framing, accompanied
by fearful imprecations invoked on her own
soul should she ever break that oath, even in the
smallest point. If the wretched Emmie so much as
hesitated before pronouncing words which seemed to
her not only horrible but almost blasphemous, the
cold steel was shaken before her eyes, as a menace
of instant death.</p>

<p>When the oath had been taken by the poor
maiden, Harper gruffly bade her rise. Emmie could
not have done so without the help of Jael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, hark &rsquo;ee, girl,&rdquo; said the ruffian, and as he
spoke he grasped Emmie&rsquo;s wrist with his left hand to
enforce his words, &ldquo;I have a hold over you besides
that of your oath. If you break it&mdash;but by a whisper,<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
but by a look&mdash;I have the means here of blowing up
the house over your head! And I will do it, rather
than myself fall into the clutches of the law. Or if
you should think to find safety by flight, I would
pursue you to the furthest end of the island, ay, or
beyond it! In the grave alone should you hide
yourself from my vengeance!&rdquo; Then, turning to
his wife, Harper added, &ldquo;Now, take that girl back
to the place from whence you brought her, and tell
her that if she flinch from keeping her oath, I shall
not flinch from keeping mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that terrible threat still sounding in her
ears, Emmie found herself again on the narrow stone
staircase, with the cold draught of air from the lower
door, which she had left open, rushing up from below.
Mrs. Harper was supporting the poor girl, or she
must have fallen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pluck up a brave heart, Miss Trevor; all is safe
as long as you keep silence,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is all safe,&mdash;my father, my brothers? Oh, is
there no danger for them in this horrible house?&rdquo;
exclaimed Emmie, who had no clear idea as to the
nature of the work in which Harper was engaged,
save that it assuredly must be evil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every one is safe so long as you are silent,&rdquo; answered
Jael Harper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Bruce&mdash;my brother&mdash;who sleeps next door<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
to that room,&mdash;oh, if he were to discover what is
passing in the haunted chamber!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie
in anguish. &ldquo;If he were to find out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never found us out, and he never will!&rdquo;
interrupted Jael, who, having supported Emmie
down the stairs, was now emerging with her on the
gravel path, where the moon, passing from the shadow
of earth, now shed her full radiance around them.
&ldquo;Think you that my husband does not take every
precaution to prevent discovery? There is no chance
of finding <i>him</i> napping. Master Bruce is regular in
his hours as clock-work; we have no difficulty whatever
in keeping out of his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce&rsquo;s methodical habits had, indeed, rendered
his occupation of the room next the haunted chamber
no great restraint upon Harper, who was not even
aware that there existed a door of communication
between the two apartments. When Bruce started
in the morning for S&mdash;&mdash;, Harper&rsquo;s working-day
also commenced. The man stopped his occupation
on Bruce&rsquo;s return, till the sound of the dinner-gong
assured him that the coast was clear, and that he
could leave his temporary retreat on the secret staircase
for the haunted chamber. There Harper was
wont to remain till warned by the bell for evening
prayer, when he usually quitted Myst Hall for the
night, gliding silently through the shrubbery, sometimes<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
shrouded in his wife&rsquo;s cloak and bonnet, and
carrying her basket, lest he should chance to be
noticed from the house. Jael&rsquo;s constant communication
with Myst Court greatly facilitated the movements
of her husband; and it need scarcely be added
that they both fared well upon the provisions which
Emmie had destined for the relief of the poor. The
Harpers now scarcely regretted what had at first
caused them serious alarm,&mdash;the determination of the
present owner of Myst Court to reside on his own
estate.</p>

<p>Emmie was somewhat relieved by the assurance
of Jael that Harper&rsquo;s work, whatever it might be,
would injure none of her family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband&rsquo;s business will no more harm any
of your people than if he were blowing soap-bubbles,&rdquo;
continued Mrs. Harper. &ldquo;For years we have found
that room quiet and convenient for&mdash;for whatever
my husband has in hand. We hoped that, the house
having the name of being haunted, no one would
have come to trouble us here. We could not keep
your family out, but we find that by caution and
management the rat can live next door to the cat,
ay, and nibble out of the cat&rsquo;s platter, without making
her stretch out her claws, or so much as shake
her whiskers. Hark! I hear a stir in the house;
you are missed; they are searching for you no doubt.<span class="pagenum">[246]</span>
There&rsquo;s the front door open, you can see the light
from it now; and I must not be found beside you.
Go, and remember your oath, Miss Trevor; and remember
what will come if you break it. Haman
Harper is a man of his word!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dizzy and bewildered as she was, and ready to
faint from the effect of the terror which she had
undergone in the haunted chamber, Emmie yet
managed to make her way to the entrance-door,
which had been left open by Vibert. With trembling
steps she passed through the hall, and thence
to her father&rsquo;s study, where she appeared in the
pitiable plight which has been described in a former
chapter.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>DEATH.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The distress which Emmie endured from her
fears and forebodings, was rendered more
intolerable by the pangs of regret. After
an emergency in which we have been suddenly called
upon to act an important part, when that acting has
proved a failure, how painfully the mind revolves
and goes over the scene, reflecting on what might
have been, what would have been, the result, had
duty been more bravely performed.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Had I had presence of mind,&mdash;the smallest presence
of mind,&mdash;and that but for one half minute,&rdquo;
thought Miss Trevor, &ldquo;I should have made my
escape, roused the household, and have been the
means of destroying some dark conspiracy of which
I now know not the end. I should have relieved
myself for ever of these dreadful, haunting fears, and
cleared from my home this mysterious shadow of
evil. Had I thought of any one but myself, my<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
miserable, worthless self,&mdash;had I but darted up a
prayer to Him who was able to save me,&mdash;I should
not have suffered myself to be bound by a horrible
oath, which it is a sin either to keep or to break. How
is it that I have so miserably failed in the hour of
trial? Is it not that I have never earnestly struggled
against the sin of Mistrust? I have perpetually
yielded to it when it met me in the common
duties of life; I have let my fears be sufficient excuse
for neglecting the call of conscience; and how could
I hope that God would give me the victory in a
great and sudden trial? Weak women, ere now,
have endured the rack and embraced the stake; but
must they not have first exercised the self-denying
martyr-spirit in the trials of daily life?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor, as he had proposed, kept his daughter
much by his side during the day which followed her
painful adventure. The father thought it better not
to ask any questions which might distress the nervous
Emmie, and for this considerate kindness the
poor girl felt very grateful. Mr. Trevor tried to
give Emmie employment and amusement in every
way that he could devise. Emmie read to him,
played to him, sang to him; but still it was too
evident to the eye of paternal affection that the
maiden&rsquo;s thoughts were wandering, and that her
spirit was still oppressed.<span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The day is fine, and mild for December; I will
drive you over to the picturesque ruin which we
have hitherto thought too distant for a winter excursion,&rdquo;
said Mr. Trevor, when he and his daughter
had finished their luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I might choose, papa,&rdquo; replied Emmie, &ldquo;I
would rather that you would take me to the cottage
of Widow Brant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s your poor <i>protge</i>, Emmie; I have
not seen her at her cottage door lately. Is she
recovering her health?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know, papa,&rdquo; replied Emmie faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that you had taken her under your
care, my love, that the poor creature has been supplied
with food from our own table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jessel has often been with some&mdash;at least&mdash;that&rsquo;s
to say&mdash;I hoped&mdash;I thought that she went
to the widow,&rdquo; stammered forth Emmie. Since the
discovery that Jael was the wife and accomplice of
Harper, Miss Trevor had lost even the small amount
of confidence which she might once have felt in this
woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Trevor looked rather surprised and annoyed
at Emmie&rsquo;s evident confusion. &ldquo;I marvel, my child,
that you should employ as your almoner and cottage
visitor a person of whom we know so little,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She offered herself,&rdquo; observed Emmie, &ldquo;and I<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
was afraid to refuse Mrs. Jessel&rsquo;s services, lest I
should give her offence. It was so foolish in me&mdash;so
wrong! Poor Widow Brant is on my conscience,
papa; but I do not like going alone to her cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why not take our good Susan with you?&rdquo;
inquired Mr. Trevor.</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s dread of Harper had been so greatly
increased by the events of the preceding night, that
she now felt Susan&rsquo;s company to be no efficient protection.
The young lady renewed her request that
her father should, at least on this one occasion, be
her companion on her walk to the hamlet. She felt
safe when leaning on his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These visits to sick women are not in my line,&rdquo;
observed Mr. Trevor, smiling, &ldquo;as I am neither
doctor nor divine. I do not neglect my tenants;
I am willing to help them according to my means;
and am proving at this moment my care for their
interests by involving myself, for their sakes, in a
very troublesome affair. But in a cottage I own
that I feel like a fish out of water. Never mind,
however; as you wish it, I am ready to-day to be
your escort; my only bargain is that you shall take
all the talking, my love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father and daughter soon set out together,
sauntered along the shrubbery, and passed through
the outer gateway. Emmie glanced timidly at the<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
almost tumble-down hovel of Harper. It was shut
up. No firelight gleamed through the cracked panes
of the single window, from the chimney issued no
smoke. The maiden saw that the tenant of that
hovel was not within it, and guessed but too easily
that he was at that moment ensconced at his mysterious
work in the haunted chamber. She could
scarcely pay any attention to her father&rsquo;s conversation,
and answered almost at random the questions
which he occasionally asked.</p>

<p>The door of Widow Brant&rsquo;s cottage was not
closed. The sound of several voices was heard
within as the Trevors approached the humble dwelling.
Some women were in the cottage, and a
gentleman in whom Mr. Trevor recognized the parish
doctor of S&mdash;&mdash;. The room was so small that the
entrance of the two visitors made it seem crowded.
Emmie&rsquo;s eye sought in vain for the widow, until she
caught sight, in a corner of the room, of a form
extended on a low bed, covered with clothes and
rags instead of a blanket, and of a face on which
were already visible the signs of approaching death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why was I not sent for before?&rdquo; said the
doctor angrily to one of the neighbours; &ldquo;this is
just the way with you all: you give yourselves up
to a quack till you have one foot in the grave, and
then send for the doctor, and expect him to work<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
miracles for your cure! Oh, I beg your pardon,
sir,&rdquo; said the medical man, interrupting himself, and
raising his hat on perceiving the presence of Mr.
Trevor and his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there no hope for the poor woman?&rdquo; asked
the master of Myst Court in a voice too low to reach
the ear of the patient. The doctor, in his reply,
observed less consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The disease has gone too far&mdash;too far&mdash;and the
poor creature&rsquo;s strength is exhausted. She cannot
struggle through now. She has been half starved
with hunger and cold, and has had neither proper
care and medicine, nor the food which was absolutely
necessary to keep up her vital powers. I can do
nothing in this case&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie had but paused to hear the doctor&rsquo;s opinion,
and then, with a heavy heart, she glided to the
bedside and bent over the dying woman. Emmie
had but once before stood by a death-bed, and that
was when she had been brought, while but a child,
to receive a mother&rsquo;s last kiss and blessing. To
Emmie the scene before her was inexpressibly solemn
and sad.</p>

<p>The widow&rsquo;s life was ebbing away, but her mind
was clear. &ldquo;I thought that you&rsquo;d have come again,&rdquo;
were the faint words which struggled forth from her
pale lips as she recognized the young lady.<span class="pagenum">[253]</span></p>

<p>Those words went to Emmie&rsquo;s heart like a knife.
There had, then, been expectation and disappointment;
the lady&rsquo;s visit had been watched for, hoped
for, and it had not been made till too late! Hollow,
wistful eyes were raised to Emmie&rsquo;s. Again the
poor sufferer spoke, but so feebly that Miss Trevor
had to bend very low indeed to catch the meaning
of what she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say I&rsquo;m dying&mdash;and death is so awful!&rdquo;
murmured the widow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to those who have given their hearts to
Him who died for sinners!&rdquo; whispered Emmie softly
in the sufferer&rsquo;s ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had no one to tell me of these things, and
I be not learned. But&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve not led a bad life;
I&rsquo;ve harmed no one,&rdquo; said the dying widow, grasping,
as so many unenlightened sinners do, at that false
hope of safety which can only break in their hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s al&rsquo;ays been a good neighbour, and a decent,
respectable body!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Blunt, who was bustling
about in the cottage, disturbing, by her noisy
presence, the chamber of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than useless for you all to come
crowding here,&rdquo; said the doctor roughly. &ldquo;Mrs.
Wall, you may be wanted, but let the rest go out
and leave the poor creature to the lady; can&rsquo;t you
let a woman die in quiet?&rdquo; And enforcing his words<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
by emphatic gestures, the doctor soon succeeded in
partially clearing the cottage. He then took his
leave of Mr. Trevor, and quitted the place in which
he knew that his medical skill could be of no avail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send Susan with blankets,&rdquo; said Mr.
Trevor to his daughter. &ldquo;Will you come with me,
Emmie, or stay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will stay,&rdquo; replied Emmie with emotion;
&ldquo;would that I had come here before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For more than an hour the young lady remained
by the dying woman, with her own hands beating
up the pillow, spreading the warm coverlet brought
by Susan over the wasted form, pouring wine, drop
by drop, between the sufferer&rsquo;s lips. For more than
an hour Emmie watched the flickering spark of life,
and tried to whisper words of holy comfort, which
the now dulled mind and deafened ear had no longer
power to receive. Then came the last struggle, the
gasp for breath, the death-rattle; the ashen hue of
death stole over the widow&rsquo;s face, one sigh&mdash;and all
was over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is gone; you can do nothing more. Had
you not better return home, miss?&rdquo; said Susan softly,
as Mrs. Wall closed the eyes of the corpse.</p>

<p>With tears and self-reproach Emmie Trevor quitted
the lifeless remains of her to whom she might once
perhaps have brought comfort, peace, and light, if<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
not the blessing of restoration to health. The young
lady was silent on her homeward way; her heart
was too full to permit her to enter into conversation
with her attendant. Emmie ran upstairs to her own
apartment, shut the door behind her, sank on her
knees beside her bed, and buried her face in her
hands. Then her feelings gushed forth in broken
confession and fervent prayer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am verily guilty concerning my fellow-creatures,&rdquo;
Emmie sobbed forth; &ldquo;guilty before men,
guilty before Thee, O my God! I have left undone
what I ought to have done, and there is no health
in my soul. Weak, selfish, and cruel, neglectful of
the duties which lay so plainly before me, I am not
worthy to lift up so much as my eyes towards
Heaven; I can but say, <i>God be merciful to me a
sinner!</i> But oh, Thou who dost pity, Thou who
dost pardon, take not away from me for ever the
talent which I have buried; say not, oh, say not to
my miserable soul, <i>I was sick, and ye visited me
not!</i> Help me to redeem the precious time which
I have hitherto wasted, to overcome the sin which
has beset and enslaved me! Increase my faith,
deepen my love; hold up my footsteps, that I slip
not on my perilous path; say to my weak, mistrustful
heart, <i>Be not afraid; I am thy God!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie wept freely while she thus confessed her<span class="pagenum">[256]</span>
sin and prayed, and then arose from her knees more
calm. She was now able to collect her thoughts;
and to strengthen her new-born resolutions she repeated
to herself Trench&rsquo;s exquisite sonnet, which, at
her uncle&rsquo;s request, she had, some time before, committed
to memory.</p>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lord, what a change within us one short hour<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spent in Thy presence will suffice to make!<br /></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>A MISTAKE.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_i.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="I" class="cap" />
<p class="cap08">It will be remembered that Emmie had, in
the morning, tried the patience of Bruce
by her strange indecision regarding a
second change of apartments. It was now no
superstitious fancy which made Emmie look upon
the room next the haunted chamber as a post of
peril. She entertained a dread lest Harper should
on some night omit his usual precautions, and that
Bruce should discover the presence of his dangerous
neighbour. What then might ensue? The spirited
young man would never suffer himself to be tied by
such an oath as his sister had taken; and of the
consequences which might follow his refusal Emmie
trembled to think. It was this peril to Bruce which
made Emmie regard a change of rooms as desirable
on her brother&rsquo;s account, though certainly not on
her own.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;It would be very dreadful to me to know that<span class="pagenum">[258]</span>
only a wall divided me from that wicked man who
threatened my life!&rdquo; thought poor Emmie. &ldquo;How
could I rest if I heard him stealthily moving about
so near, even though aware that he could not possibly
reach me?&rdquo; Had the maiden known that
there was actually a door in that dividing wall, her
terror would have been yet greater. But Emmie
believed that the corridor entrance being bricked up,
there was no outlet from the haunted chamber but
by the door which opened on the secret stairs.
Ignorant as she was of the means of nearer communication
between the two apartments, it was but
the strain on her nerves that Emmie dreaded when
suggesting her own return to the room which had
been assigned to her at the first.</p>

<p>But this dread was so great, that, as we have
seen, Emmie could not in the morning summon up
courage to press the arrangement on Bruce. She
had wavered, hesitated, drawn back. But Emmie
had learned much during the last few painful hours;
the effect which her uncle&rsquo;s warnings had failed to
produce, followed the solemn teachings of conscience
by the widow&rsquo;s death-bed. Humbly and prayerfully
Emmie now resolved to bend all her efforts to conquer
mistrust, to subdue the opposition of shrinking
nature, and obey God&rsquo;s will at however painful a
cost. Emmie determined to brave Bruce&rsquo;s displeasure<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
at her apparent inconsistency and folly, and
return to the hated room, in which her danger would
at any rate be less than that of her brother.</p>

<p>But Emmie had on that evening no opportunity
of carrying out her resolution. Bruce returned to
Myst Court at his usual hour, but looking and feeling
so ill, that he could not be troubled with anything
in the way of household arrangements. He had one
of the severe attacks of headache to which the young
man was subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not be with you at dinner to-day,&rdquo; said
Bruce to his sister; &ldquo;like a bear, I shall keep in my
den, and have my growl out by myself. I&rsquo;ve my
fire ready lit, my kettle on the hob, and my little
tea-caddy on the table. I want nothing but quiet
and rest, and shall be all right in the morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce was proverbially a bad patient, and would
never submit to what he called coddling. Emmie
knew that he now meant what he said, and that she
should only annoy her brother by offering to sit
beside him, or bring him food which he would not
touch. The brother and sister, therefore, bade each
other good-night; and Bruce, taking a lighted candle,
with slow step mounted the staircase, then drew
back the heavy tapestry curtain, and passed on to
his own apartment.</p>

<p>The fire blazed and crackled cheerily. Bruce,<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
instead of going to rest at once, drew a chair in
front of it, seated himself with his feet on the fender,
and pressing his hot forehead with his hand, remained
for some time in absolute stillness. He let his mind
rest as well as his frame, not fatiguing it by following
out any definite chain of ideas.</p>

<p>Thus young Trevor remained till he heard from
below the sound of the gong which summoned the
family to dinner. About five minutes afterwards,
Bruce raised his head to listen to a different sound,
much nearer to where he sat. It came from a place
from whence he had never before heard the faintest
noise. There was&mdash;he could not be mistaken&mdash;the
voice of some one speaking in the haunted chamber!</p>

<p>Bruce&rsquo;s sensation on hearing it was not that of
fear, scarcely even that of curiosity. When once
young Trevor had taken an idea into his mind, he
was wont to hold it with a pertinacity which
savoured of obstinacy. Bruce was very slow to own,
even to himself, that he had made a mistake. The
notion now in the young man&rsquo;s brain was that his
giddy brother had determined to try his courage by
playing on him some practical joke. Vibert&rsquo;s sudden
proposal to go up to London Bruce considered but as
an attempt to throw dust into his eyes, and to put
him off his guard; and the elder brother smiled to
himself at the idea of Vibert&rsquo;s imagining that he<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
really could take him in by so transparent an attempt
at deception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert is no more in London at this moment
than I am,&rdquo; had been the reflection of Bruce. &ldquo;He
never thought of going thither till I casually let out
that it is possible to enter the haunted chamber.&rdquo;
And now, when a voice was heard in that chamber,
Bruce but knitted his brow, and muttered impatiently
to himself, &ldquo;Could he not have kept his foolery for
a better time; I am in no mood for nonsense to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another voice seemed to reply to the first, both
speaking in low tones, and not distinctly enough for
the import of their words to be understood by the
listening Bruce. Still his suspicions were not
aroused, for the power to mimic various tones was
one of the accomplishments which added to Vibert&rsquo;s
popularity in ladies&rsquo; society. Then followed a
creaking sound, as of the winding of a windlass, or
the turning of the screw of a press. This puzzled
Bruce, and made him alter his first intention of simply
locking the door of communication between the two
rooms, and so imprisoning the pseudo-ghost till the
morning. Young Trevor, of course, knew nothing
of the third door of the bricked-up chamber, or the
secret staircase beyond it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may as well put an end to this folly at once,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
said Bruce, rising and looking around for some convenient
weapon with which to chastise, or rather to
alarm, the disturber of his repose. He took up his
gun, but did not attempt to load it. Why should
he do so when he had no intention of startling the
household and frightening his sister by the sudden
report of fire-arms? Vibert would not be able to
tell by a glance whether the gun were or were not
loaded. The object of Bruce was to frighten, but
not to injure his brother.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was to get the door-key,
which Bruce had left on his mantel-piece. He
scarcely expected to find it there still, but there it
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert must have taken the precaution of
replacing after using it,&rdquo; thought Bruce, as he
took up the key; &ldquo;and he has been artful enough
to leave my map still hanging up over the panel-door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very softly Bruce now lifted off the large varnished
map from its nail, and laid it down on the floor.
His object was, by his sudden appearance with his
gun, to startle his brother. Noiselessly Bruce
turned the key in the lock, noiselessly pushed open
the door in the panel, then suddenly sprang into the
lighted chamber, with a loud exclamation of &ldquo;Ha!
have I caught you at it?&rdquo; To Bruce&rsquo;s amazement,<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
as well as their own, he found himself confronted
by Harper and Colonel Standish!</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that on his sudden recognition
of these night-visitors, whom nought but an
evil purpose could have brought to that place, to the
heart of the youth &ldquo;the life-blood thrilled with
sudden start.&rdquo; But Harper had now no timid girl
to deal with. Raising his unloaded gun so as to
cover now the one man, then the other, Bruce in a
loud voice demanded, &ldquo;Villains! what do ye here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seizing the instant when the gun was pointed at
his companion, Standish made a dart forwards and
struck up the arm of Bruce. In another moment
the two were locked in a deadly grapple.</p>

<p>Even then Bruce Trevor retained his presence of
mind. Wrestling and struggling as he was, with a
hand stronger than his own griping at his throat,
and stifling the cry of &ldquo;Robbers! help!&rdquo; which
would have burst from his lips, Bruce did his utmost
to back through the doorway into his room. Could
he but reach his bell-rope, he could bring his father
and the servant to his assistance, and so overcome
and perhaps capture his assailants. But in vain the
young man struggled and strained every muscle in
his frame, too closely grappled with by Standish to
be able even to strike with the but-end of his gun.
The strength of Bruce was failing, though not his<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
courage; the odds were too heavy against him.
While Standish, with throttling grasp, was pinning
him against the wall, Harper, with some heavy instrument,
came and struck the youth on the head.
Bruce saw no more, felt no more than the one sharp
pang of the blow. He fell heavily on the floor, at
the mercy of the ruffians whose lurking-place he had
on that night discovered!</p>

<p>In the meantime, the master of Myst Court was
calmly sipping his claret, and telling to his daughter
amusing stories of old adventures, all unconscious of
the fearful scene going on within the walls of his
own dwelling.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>STRANGE TIDINGS.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_w.jpg" width="85" height="85" alt="W" class="cap" />
<p class="cap14">When Emmie arose on the following morning,
the landscape was covered with a
soft mantle of snow. A few flakes were
still falling, ever and anon, from a sky whence
lowering clouds shut out the pale gleam of a winter
daybreak.</p></div>

<p>Emmie arose with an earnest resolution on her
mind&mdash;a resolution born of repentance, and gathering
strength from prayer. She would no longer be
the weak, selfish, useless being, whom every shadow
could turn from the path of duty. She would listen
for a Father&rsquo;s guiding voice; she would cling to the
helping Hand; she would, through God&rsquo;s promised
help, realize His protecting presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will beseech the Lord to enable me never,
never again to mistrust His power or His love, or
to doubt His promise that all things shall work together
for good to His children,&rdquo; said Emmie to<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
herself, as she opened her Bible; and in that Bible
she read the touching history of those who once
walked unharmed in the burning fiery furnace.</p>

<p>It was thus that the weak soldier of Christ put
on armour to resist her besetting sin. She would,
ere the close of that day, sorely need that armour of
proof.</p>

<p>When Emmie had finished her reading, she rose
and looked forth from her casement. She saw an
open vehicle approaching along the snow-covered
road towards Myst Court. Three men were seated
within it, besides the driver. It was with no common
interest that the maiden watched their approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Policemen!&mdash;London policemen!&mdash;and with an
inspector!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie in surprise, for she
recognized the familiar uniform of the officers of the
law. &ldquo;What can be bringing them hither? Can
Harper&rsquo;s secret have been discovered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s heart thrilled with mingled fear and
hope. Had the officers of justice received information
of some secret plot,&mdash;had they come to search
the house,&mdash;would light be thrown on its dark recesses?
Such was Emmie&rsquo;s hope, but still linked
with a trembling fear. What might not Harper do,
in his desperation, if he were driven to bay? Would
he not conclude that her lips had betrayed his secret,
that she had broken her solemn oath?<span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<p>Emmie lost sight of the vehicle as it stopped
before the large entrance-door of Myst Court, which
was not overlooked by her window. She heard
the policemen&rsquo;s ring at the bell, she heard her
father&rsquo;s firm step as he descended the stairs to meet
his early and most unexpected visitors. Emmie
would have followed him at once, but the tresses of
her long hair still floated down over her shoulders.
The young lady was not independent of the help of
a maid, and rang her bell for Susan.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and no Susan appeared. There
were sounds of steps and voices in the house, but
not near Emmie&rsquo;s apartment. Her curiosity made
her impatient; she rang again, and more loudly;
and as there was still delay in answering the summons,
Emmie resolved to wait no longer, and herself
gathered up and twisted into a knot, as best she
might, her long, luxuriant hair. She had just finished
her toilette when Susan entered at last, looking
flushed and excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon, miss,&rdquo; said the lady&rsquo;s-maid; &ldquo;but I
could not come sooner. The police are here, and they
have been questioning me and the other servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they come to search the house?&rdquo; cried
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; they brought a warrant from London
to do that,&rdquo; was Susan&rsquo;s reply.<span class="pagenum">[268]</span></p>

<p>Almost breathless with anxiety and hope, Emmie
asked if they had searched the haunted chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first place they went to,&rdquo; said
Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was any one there, any one arrested?&rdquo;
cried Emmie, trembling with eagerness to hear the
reply, which might loose the knot of her perplexity,
and free her for ever from haunting terrors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one was found in this house, miss,&rdquo; answered
Susan, with a look of distress. &ldquo;There were strange
presses and instruments found, as I heard, in the
haunted room, such as must have been used in
forging those dreadful bank-notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forging bank-notes! so that was the crime!&rdquo;
said Emmie under her breath. &ldquo;And is any one
suspected?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>Susan at first looked perplexed, and avoided meeting
her lady&rsquo;s questioning glance. She then answered,
&ldquo;There is a warrant out for the arrest of Colonel
Standish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Standish!&rdquo; echoed Emmie in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police had been at S&mdash;&mdash;, at the White
Hart, before they came here,&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;but the
colonel had gone off, no one knows where. He had
not been seen or heard of since yesterday morning.
He owes a large debt at the hotel, and his stealing<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
off thus, without paying it, makes every one think
him guilty about the forged notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never believed him to be a real gentleman,&rdquo;
observed Emmie. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added anxiously, &ldquo;is
he thought to have had no accomplice?&rdquo; The
maiden, bound by her oath, dared not so much as
mention the name of Harper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that I hear master calling me,&rdquo; said
Susan; and without answering her lady&rsquo;s question,
she hurried from the apartment.</p>

<p>Emmie was standing near the window, and from
it she now saw Joe leading her own pony-chaise
from the stables towards the entrance of the house,
and at a quick pace that told of haste. What was
the vehicle brought for at so early an hour? Perhaps&mdash;so
thought Emmie Trevor&mdash;to take one or
more of the policemen back to S&mdash;&mdash;. Yet scarcely
so, for their own conveyance was waiting.</p>

<p>The maiden was not kept long in doubt. It was
her own father that she saw in the chaise, a few
seconds afterwards, urging on the pony to a frantic
pace, plunging through the drifted snow as if life or
death hung on its speed! Joe sat behind, while
his master drove as Emmie had never seen her father
drive before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can be the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie;
&ldquo;papa has forgotten even his greatcoat, and the<span class="pagenum">[270]</span>
weather is so cold, and it looks as if a storm would
come on!&rdquo; She watched the chaise till it disappeared
behind intervening trees and brushwood.</p>

<p>Susan re-entered the room as her young lady,
anxious and wondering, turned from the casement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know where my father is going?&rdquo;
Emmie inquired of her maid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master is going to London, miss,&rdquo; was the
answer; &ldquo;but I doubt whether the pony can gallop
fast enough to take him in time for the train.
Master was in great haste, or he would have come
to bid you good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What takes him to London?&rdquo; cried Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this bank-note forgery business,&rdquo; said
Susan, the look of uneasiness passing again over her
face. &ldquo;Master called me to give you a message,
miss. He says that while the police have charge of
the house, he&mdash;he does not wish you to speak to
them, miss, or question them about the matter which
has brought them here. Master is anxious about
you. He has ordered me to take care that no one
should disturb or intrude upon you, Miss Trevor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The police are not likely to disturb the innocent,
nor to intrude on ladies,&rdquo; said Emmie, smiling
from the pleasant assurance of safety conveyed by
their presence in the mansion. &ldquo;If my father does
not wish me to question them or see them, of course<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
his will shall be obeyed. I must depend on you for
my information, or&mdash;where is my brother, Master
Bruce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell, miss; he is not in the house;
he must have gone out,&rdquo; replied Susan in a flurried
manner. The quiet, respectable, lady&rsquo;s-maid had
never before been examined by a superintendent of
police, and her usual self-possession had forsaken her
on that eventful morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce must have heard something of this warrant
against Standish,&rdquo; thought Emmie; &ldquo;perhaps
he has gone off early to S&mdash;&mdash;, to help in the search
after this daring impostor. I am glad that he felt
well enough to do so; but how he could have received
such early information of what has occurred,
I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie now went down-stairs to the breakfast
room; there was no family-prayer in the confusion
of that strange day. Susan brought in a tray with
her young lady&rsquo;s breakfast, in the absence of Joe.
Emmie was not disposed to touch it. She lingered
near the window, half hoping that Bruce might appear,
or that her father, having missed the early
train, might return to Myst Court. The policemen
were very quiet; only the sound of a heavy tread,
now and then, showed that they were in the house;
but Emmie saw nothing of the officers of the law.<span class="pagenum">[272]</span></p>

<p>There were signs, however, that the unusual occurrences
which had taken place at Myst Court had
excited curiosity and interest in the surrounding
neighbourhood. Knots of persons, not only from
the hamlet, but apparently even from the town, came
up the carriage-drive, as it seemed for no purpose
but to stare up, open-mouthed, at the house. There
was much shaking of heads and whispering amongst
these spectators; but they had caught sight of the
lady looking forth from the window, and nothing
was uttered by them loud enough for its import
to be distinguished by Emmie through the closed
window.</p>

<p>Presently the wind rose in wild gusts, whirling
the snow into blinding drifts; dark clouds were
sweeping over the sky; all portended a violent
storm; and the assembled crowd hastily retreated
from the grounds of Myst Court, to seek refuge from
the fury of the tempest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would give anything to know whether Harper
and his wife are under suspicion!&rdquo; said Emmie to
herself. &ldquo;Susan is so strangely unwilling to give
full information, she stammers as she answers my
questions. I think that my father must have
charged her to say nothing that could possibly agitate
my nerves. He has desired that his weak
daughter should be kept from excitement; and thus<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
I, who have the deepest interest in all that is happening
here, am more ignorant of what is going on than
any servant in the household. I must question
Susan again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie was about to ring the bell for her maid;
but before she did so, there was a quick tap at the
door, and, without waiting for the lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
Hannah entered the room. The cook looked more
excited than Susan had done; but while, in the
case of the latter, there had been an appearance of
perplexity, if not of pain, with a desire to speak as
little as she could, Hannah&rsquo;s face, on the contrary,
showed that she was not only brimming over with
news, but that she had a vulgar pleasure in being
the first to impart it. &ldquo;Now I shall know all,&rdquo;
thought Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La, miss!&rdquo; exclaimed Hannah, &ldquo;to think of
you taking your breakfast so quietly here, as if
nothing had happened, when there be such goings
on in the place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one arrested?&rdquo; asked Emmie eagerly.
She dared not mention the names of Harper or
Jessel, lest, by turning suspicion on them, she should
indirectly violate her oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one took up yet, that I know of, but he in
London,&rdquo; said Hannah. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t master go off like
a shot, as soon as he heard the news!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[274]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What news? who was taken up?&rdquo; asked
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;La, miss! you don&rsquo;t mean to say that you&rsquo;ve
not heard of the scrape of poor Master Vibert, how
he&rsquo;s been catched and put into jail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie staggered backwards as though she had
been struck. &ldquo;Put into jail! my brother! and on
what pretext?&rdquo; she exclaimed, grasping the table
for support.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it&mdash;you ought to know,
seeing you&rsquo;re his own sister,&rdquo; said Hannah, enjoying
the excitement of the scene, and yet not without
a touch of natural pity, on seeing the anguish which
she inflicted. &ldquo;Master Vibert went yesterday to
London, you know; and when he got there, he
went off straight to a jeweller (Golding, I think, is
the name), and bought from him lots of jewels, diamonds,
pearls, and all kinds of gim-cracks, worth
more than a thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he did buy the jewels, and paid for them
too with a lot of nice, fresh, clean ten-pound notes,&rdquo;
said Hannah. &ldquo;The shopman didn&rsquo;t suspect nothing
at first, &rsquo;cause he knew the young gentleman&rsquo;s
face so well, as he&rsquo;d often dealt at the shop. But
when the head of the firm, as they call him, came
in the afternoon to look after the business (there&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
nothing like a master&rsquo;s eye, we know), he said the
notes weren&rsquo;t real and honest bank-notes; and off
he went at once to the biggest police-station in
London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother has been the unconscious tool of a
villain!&rdquo; murmured Emmie, who felt certain that
Vibert&rsquo;s vanity and careless security must have made
him the victim of the impostor who had called himself
Colonel Standish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The p&rsquo;lice and Mr. Golding drove off to
Grosvenor Square,&rdquo; continued Hannah, &ldquo;for the
jeweller knew the address; and a mighty bustle
and fuss was caused by their coming, for there was
an afternoon party, and the gentlefolk were amazed
when they found that he who had been the merriest
of them all was to be haled up afore a magistrate,
on a charge of passing forged notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not my brother at once clear himself from
suspicion?&rdquo; cried Emmie, the paleness of whose face
was now exchanged for the crimson flush of indignation
and shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master Vibert said that the notes had been
given to him by a Colonel Standish; and that he
had bought the jewels for Colonel Standish; and
that he would have sent them off at once to some
address in Liverpool, only he had waited to have
out his dance.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[276]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then are the jewels safe in the hands of the
police?&rdquo; asked Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay; I wish that this cheat of a colonel were so
too,&rdquo; replied Hannah. &ldquo;Hanging is too good for
him, say I; for sure and certain it was his wheedling
which made poor Master Vibert do so wicked a
thing. Some of the police were sent off to Liverpool,
and some hurried down to S&mdash;&mdash;. And first
they searched the colonel&rsquo;s lodgings, and then they
came ferreting here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they easily find their way into the bricked-up
room?&rdquo; asked Emmie, who knew of no way of
access into it but by the secret staircase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you, miss, what could be easier, when
the door was wide open &rsquo;twixt that room and
Master Bruce&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie started, and turned deadly pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well start with surprise, miss; all of
us were astonished to find there was any door in
that wall. Lizzie declares that even she never
knew that there was one, though she tidies the room
every day. Master Bruce was so sly&mdash;he was&mdash;hanging
the big map over the place!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you speak thus of my brother?&rdquo; cried
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t my speaking, but every one&rsquo;s speaking,&rdquo;
said Hannah, firing up at the word of rebuke. &ldquo;The<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
police say as how young master could not have slept
in the one room for a month, and have been innocent
as a babe of what was going on in the other.
Ay, they said that of him, Miss Trevor, before they&rsquo;d
found a lot of the odd kind of paper of which bank-notes
are made in one of his drawers. I wonder
young master did not throw it all into the fire before
he absconded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emmie pressed her temples with both her icy
cold hands. Her brain was reeling. Half unconsciously,
she echoed the word &ldquo;Absconded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what the p&rsquo;lice called it; and they&rsquo;re
going to take out a warrant against Master Bruce,&rdquo;
said Hannah. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain he went off last night,
for his bed had never been slept in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was to Emmie the crowning horror. There
had been a door then&mdash;an open door&mdash;between her
brother&rsquo;s room and that haunted by the presence of
the unscrupulous Harper; and Bruce&mdash;the noble, the
brave&mdash;had disappeared during the night!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me, leave me!&rdquo; cried Emmie wildly;
and, alarmed at the lady&rsquo;s ghastly looks, the bearer
of evil tidings at once obeyed her command. Hannah
had said more than enough, and now retreated
in alarm, lest the effect of her words should have
been to turn her young mistress&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>THE WEAK ONE.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_e.jpg" width="85" height="84" alt="E" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">Emmie remained for a few brief seconds as
if transfixed into stone. More wretched
was she even than her father, who had
rushed off to London on hearing of the arrest of his
younger son, without knowing that any danger or
disgrace threatened the elder. It need not be said
that Emmie never for one instant doubted the innocence
of either; her present intense agony arose
from her fear regarding the fate of Bruce.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;In that fatal room which he has occupied
through my own selfish folly,&rdquo; so flowed the stream
of thought like burning lava through the poor girl&rsquo;s
brain, &ldquo;Bruce has heard&mdash;has discovered the forgers.
He would take no cowardly oath, and they have
murdered him to ensure his silence. What a fearful
fate may have overtaken mine own brave brother!
But, oh! may merciful Heaven have shielded his
precious life!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[279]</span></p>

<p>Susan entered the room, alarmed by the account
of the state of her mistress given by Hannah. She
expected to find Miss Trevor either fainting or in
hysterics, but to her surprise the lady was perfectly
calm. This was no time to give way to weakness;
the very extremity of Emmie&rsquo;s anguish subdued its
outward expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to the policemen, Susan; tell them that I
am certain that my brother Bruce has been the
victim of some foul deed,&rdquo; she said with distinct
articulation though a quivering, bloodless lip. &ldquo;Let
every corner of this house, from attic to cellar, be
searched; a thousand pounds&rsquo; reward to whoever
shall find Bruce Trevor!&rdquo; Emmie waved her hand
impatiently to urge speed, and Susan hastened from
the apartment, scarcely more certain of young
Trevor&rsquo;s innocence, or less anxious regarding his
fate, than was his unhappy sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two guilty ones who are likely enough
to be able to throw light on this dark mystery,&rdquo;
said Emmie to herself; &ldquo;Harper, and that wretched
woman his wife. But can I set the police on their
track without breaking my oath, my horrible oath?
Would Heaven, in this dreadful emergency, condemn
me for that, or suffer that those awful imprecations
which I was forced to utter should fall on my body
and soul? Is there any other course open before me<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
in this maddening misery of doubt?&rdquo; Emmie made
two hurried steps towards the door, and then
paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one other course; yes, I see it. I could
go myself&mdash;alone&mdash;to the dwelling of Jael; there is
something of the woman left in her still, she protected
my life from her husband. Bruce may be
living still, but kept in confinement,&rdquo;&mdash;a gleam of
hope came with that thought,&mdash;&ldquo;not in Harper&rsquo;s
hovel, which is too small and too close to others to
be used as a hiding-place or a prison, but possibly
in Jael&rsquo;s, which stands by itself. I will go thither.
Threats, promises, entreaties, all will I use to win
from her at least some tidings of my lost brother!
If I go alone I break no oath, and Jael will be able
henceforth implicitly to trust in my honour. She
may confide to me things which she would effectually
conceal from officers of justice. Yes, I will go
alone. Oh, God of mercy, help and direct me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One measure of precaution suggested itself to the
mind of Emmie, who could not dissociate the idea
of personal danger from intercourse with any of
those concerned in the forgery plot. She tore a
leaf from her pocket-book, and wrote upon it the
few following lines, to be left on the dining-room
table. &ldquo;<i>If there be tidings of my brother, or if I be
long in returning, seek for me at the house of Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
Jessel.</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no breach of my oath in writing
this,&rdquo; thought Emmie, as she added her initials to
the lines which she had hastily penned.</p>

<p>Emmie&rsquo;s garden-hat and scarlet shawl were hung
up in the hall; she sought no other equipment for
her walk through the wood, though the clouds were
hanging like a pall over the white earth, and the
wind was now furiously high. Emmie did not
pursue the path by the drive that would have led
to the hamlet and the highway; there was a short
cut through the woods to the dwelling of Jael, and
the maiden took it, sheltering herself as best she
might against the tempest which raged round her
fragile form. The poor girl felt that she was on a
dangerous enterprise. She knew not whom or what
she might meet in the place to which she was going;
she had not forgotten the gleam of Harper&rsquo;s sharp
blade, or the fierce threat expressed in his eyes. It
may be marvelled at that one so timid as was
Emmie should venture without protection to a
dwelling in which might be lurking those whom
she knew to be criminals,&mdash;those who, as she fearfully
suspected, might be murderers also. It was indeed
sisterly affection that impelled Emmie onwards,
but her support, her strength, was in prayer.
Emmie was trusting now as she never had trusted
before; she was leaning on, clinging to the invisible<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
arm that could hold her up, to the love which would
never forsake her.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Vibert&rsquo;s miserable
position was forgotten by Emmie in her terrors on
account of his brother. But for Vibert the sister could
do nothing but pray; his father was hastening to his
aid: her whole energies, Emmie felt, must be concentrated
on her own special work,&mdash;that of discovering
the fate of Bruce Trevor.</p>

<p>Emmie had gone more than half-way to the
dwelling of Jael, when the thunder-cloud above her
burst in a storm compared to which that one which
she had encountered on the evening of her arrival
was but as the play of summer lightning. Never
before had the trembling girl heard such deafening
peals as those which now shook the welkin, while
the rattling hail descended with fury. Branches
above and on either side creaked and snapped in the
gale, and some were whirled with violence across
the path of the maiden. Emmie started, shuddered,
and drew her shawl over her head for protection
against the blast and the hail, but still she struggled
onwards. She uttered no shriek, but she gasped
forth a prayer; it was the moan of one in anguish,
not the cry of one in despair.</p>

<p>That storm was one of the most terrible which
had ever been known in England. The newspapers<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
on the following day recorded many a wreck on the
coast, many an accident in inland localities. They
told of stacks of chimneys blown down, and a church
spire struck by lightning; they recorded how cattle
had been killed by the fall of a tree, and a sportsman
in the field struck dead with his gun in his hand.
Emmie always remembered that storm as a horrible
dream, and wondered how she had been strengthened
to endure what terrified nature so shrank from.
But personal fear was partly neutralized by a yet
more absorbing fear; to gain tidings of Bruce,
Emmie felt that she would bear the shock of the
fiercest storm that ever swept over the earth.</p>

<p>The maiden emerged unharmed from the wood,
safe at least from danger of injury by lightning-struck
tree, or branches torn off by the gale. She
had been preserved through one terrible peril; and
would not the Power that had helped her hitherto
sustain and protect to the end?</p>

<p>Emmie had now reached a road which skirted
an open heath, and the lone dwelling of Jael Harper
stood not a hundred yards before her. It was a
narrow, two-storied house, standing in a small
garden; both house and garden were whitened with
snow, as was the little path which connected the
door with the road. The hail had spent itself in
that sharp and furious downfall, but the blinding<span class="pagenum">[284]</span>
lightning flashed faster than ever its forked, jagged
darts through the sky.</p>

<p>As Emmie with desperate resolution approached
the garden-gate of that dwelling which was as
fearful to her as a lion&rsquo;s den might have been, she
noticed on the snow-covered road the tracks of cartwheels,
and on the garden pathway those of feet.
The latter were all in a direction which showed that
though several persons might have quitted the house
since the fall of snow on the preceding night, no
one could have entered it. Emmie leaned for a few
moments against the low garden-paling to gather
her thoughts; the noise of the storm and the terror
of her mind made it difficult even to think.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Footprints from the door to the road, some
larger, some smaller as if made by a woman, and
some left by wide nailed boots, all pointing this
way,&rdquo; murmured Emmie; &ldquo;three persons must have
left the house this morning, and I stand on the
track of wheels. All then have absconded,&mdash;they
have fled from justice; that den of wickedness must
be empty.&rdquo; Emmie looked across the garden at
the door with its iron studs and large old-fashioned
knocker, and felt assured that the loudest summons
on that knocker would not cause that door to open.
The shutters of the windows were all closed, the
house was evidently shut up and deserted. The<span class="pagenum">[285]</span>
young lady could not get in; wherefore, then, should
she stay? Would it not be better to return home
at once, and hear if the strict search after Bruce
which must have followed her offer of large reward
had been of any avail?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! why did I madly come hither?&rdquo; exclaimed
Emmie, personal fear again rising into
terror, as she contemplated returning through the
wood whilst the dreadful storm still raged. &ldquo;That
lightning! oh, how awful the flash! The heavens
seem to be splitting asunder! But do not the
lightnings obey God&rsquo;s bidding? Is it not the voice
of my Father which I hear in the thunder? Even
if it bring His summons to His child, should I fear
to go unto Him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While her faith was wrestling thus with her fear,
the attention of Emmie was attracted by a small
object near her, almost covered with snow, which,
strangely enough on that winter day, looked something
like a rosebud. Its soft crimson hue contrasted
with the whiteness of the snow under which
it was lying half buried. There was something curiously
familiar to Emmie in the appearance of that
flower, which did not seem like a work of nature.
The small thing, whatever it might be, was but two
steps from the spot where Emmie stood leaning
against the paling. Emmie turned towards the<span class="pagenum">[286]</span>
place where lay the object, and, though she could
scarcely have given a reason for so doing, she
stooped and raised it. With emotions which no
pen can describe, the trembling girl drew out from
the snow <i>a man&rsquo;s slipper</i>&mdash;a slipper which her own
fingers had worked for her brother! Emmie sank
on her knees with a faint cry of anguish. How
had that slipper come there, and when? and, oh!
where, where was he who had worn it? Did that
deserted house conceal some fearful&mdash;</p>

<p>The chain of thought was broken by an explosive
crash of heaven&rsquo;s artillery in the cloud above, and,
almost simultaneously with the peal, a fire-ball
struck the house, by the garden-gate of which
Emmie was crouching, still on her knees. The
noise was so tremendous that the maiden for a brief
space lost sense of hearing and power of thinking;
she was deafened and bewildered, and remained
motionless and breathless, with the slipper clenched
in her grasp. But the thunder-clap was soon over,
and miserable consciousness of her position returned
to poor Emmie. The sight of that slipper roused
her to a more sickening fear than could be caused
by lightning or thunder.</p>

<p>Emmie started to her feet, and again turned her
wild gaze on the lonely house. It had been fast
closed against her entrance, but (attracted, perhaps,<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
by the metal on the door) Heaven&rsquo;s bolt had torn
its way through; it had smashed through woodwork
and brickwork, and made a ghastly breach, charred
and blackened, as if a bomb had exploded there to
make an opening for destroyers! There was nothing
now but her own terror to hinder the maiden from
exploring the lightning-stricken dwelling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Father&mdash;mercy&mdash;help!&rdquo; burst in almost unconscious
prayer from Emmie&rsquo;s quivering lips, as
she lifted the latch of the gate. With rapid steps
she crossed the little garden by the snow-covered
path, and over the charred and splintered wreck of
a door made her way into the house which she had
so much dreaded to enter. To Emmie it seemed as
if she were borne onwards by some invisible power,
and were scarcely a voluntary agent; but this sensation
was the effect of excited fancy.</p>

<p>Emmie was now in the narrow passage of Jael&rsquo;s
house; to her right was an open door, beyond
which lay a room, dark indeed, for the shutters of
its window were closed, yet not utterly so, for daylight
forced its way in through chinks, and there was
a faint reflected light from the wall of the passage.
Into that room Emmie now turned, groping her way
forwards with hands extended. Her object was to
reach the window and throw open the shutters, and
so gain fuller light by which to pursue her dreadful<span class="pagenum">[288]</span>
search for&mdash;perhaps a brother&rsquo;s corpse! But ere
Emmie could feel her way to the window, her bare
and icy-cold hand came in contact with something
soft and damp&mdash;something resembling a human face!
Emmie could not stifle a cry of horror. Her first
emotion was that of terror, the next that of almost
ecstatic hope, as the maiden&rsquo;s straining eyes traced
through the deep gloom the outline of a form, not
standing upright, but apparently leaning against or
fastened to some heavy piece of furniture. This
form, of which she had accidentally touched the
face, was assuredly not dead, for the flesh had some
slight warmth, and the head had slightly moved
when her hand came in contact with it. Emmie
sprang to the window, raised the bar, and flung the
shutters wide open. What a sight did daylight reveal!
On his knees, with his back to a table to
which he was bound, while his mouth was gagged
with his own neckcloth, Emmie, as she turned from
the window, beheld her brother&mdash;her own lost
Bruce!</p>

<p>Almost in the twinkling of an eye the prisoner&rsquo;s
mouth was freed from its bonds. The exclamations
&ldquo;My sister! my preserver!&rdquo; which burst from the
young man&rsquo;s lips, showed that neither the sense of
recognition nor power of utterance was lost. Emmie
then attempted to free the arms of Bruce, which<span class="pagenum">[289]</span>
were bound with a rope behind him; but to accomplish
this work required more time and far greater
effort. The knot was not easily unloosed, and the
slender delicate fingers of Emmie, though she exerted
their utmost strength, could not for several
minutes accomplish their difficult task. Whilst
Emmie was straining at the tight knot, quickened
in her efforts by a faint moan from her suffering
brother, she noticed not whether lightning flashed
or thunder rolled; she seemed for the time to have
lost all personal fear; self-consciousness was swallowed
up in anxious care for another.</p>

<p>At length the rope end was dragged through the
last cruel loop, and Bruce Trevor was free. Emmie,
with thankful delight, threw her arms round the
neck of her brother, and, for the first time on that
terrible day, burst into a flood of tears. Her brother
feebly returned her embrace, and wept like a child.
Emmie was surprised, and even alarmed, at the
emotion to which Bruce Trevor gave way. Had
it been Vibert who had wept&mdash;Vibert, ever impulsive,
and without any self-control&mdash;Emmie would
neither have wondered nor feared; but that Bruce,
the firm Bruce, who since childhood had never been
known to shed a tear&mdash;that Bruce should actually
sob, showed that even his powers of endurance
must have been overstrained at last, and that his<span class="pagenum">[290]</span>
strong nerves had been shaken by torture, either
physical or mental.</p>

<p>And suffering was written on the young man&rsquo;s
face; not only in the ghastly wound which Harper&rsquo;s
blow had left on his brow, but in the hollow eyes,
the haggard cheek, the lips which had lost for
a while their expression of calm decision. Bruce
had secretly prided himself on his firmness; he had
to be taught that no merely human courage can be
proof against every trial, as his sister had been
taught that human weakness can be raised into
heroism by the power of faith and prayer.</p>

<p>But soon the strong will struggled against human
infirmity. Mastering his emotion by a convulsive
effort, Bruce was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you here? who is with you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one is with me; I think that God led me
here,&rdquo; was Emmie&rsquo;s reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He led you indeed,&rdquo; murmured Bruce. &ldquo;The
cords were cutting into my flesh, my position was
torture; another half-hour and reason or life must
have given way. But for you to come alone, in the
storm, and to such a place as this, is scarcely less
than a miracle&mdash;you, Emmie, who dreaded the
lightning!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed was the lightning! it did His bidding;<span class="pagenum">[291]</span>
it made a way for me to enter and save you,&rdquo; cried
Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for that crashing bolt you would never
have seen me alive,&rdquo; said Bruce. As he spoke, the
young man turned his head with a quick, uneasy
movement, like a sentinel at night who detects the
sound of a stealthy tread. Emmie saw the movement,
and her heart throbbed fast with sympathetic
alarm. Could the forgers be returning to make
sure of their victim? But the apprehension expressed
in the face of Bruce arose from a different
cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mark you not that smell of burning?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;See the smoke rolling in through the doorway;
the bolt has set the house on fire; we must make
our escape before the building be wrapped in
flames!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce was in so exhausted a state, and his limbs
had been so cramped by the painful position in
which he had for hours remained, that without the
support of his sister&rsquo;s slight arm he could scarcely
have moved even a few steps forward. Very strange
was it to Emmie to find that her brother leaned
upon her&mdash;that it was given to the weak to support
the strong, to the timid to encourage the brave.
The relative positions of brother and sister were reversed
at that crisis of danger; the pride of man<span class="pagenum">[292]</span>
was brought low, whilst strength was given to the
humble and meek.</p>

<p>Smoke, blinding and half-suffocating smoke, filled
the passage through which Emmie now guided her
brother&rsquo;s faltering steps. Sparks flew around, the
heat was intense, the roaring sound of flames mingled
with the noise of the storm. But there was no
actual obstacle to the departure of the fugitives from
the burning house, and over the wreck of the shattered
door they passed forth into outer air. Here they
felt comparatively safe; the snowy waste which
spread around them promised protection at least
from any danger from fire. The storm was gradually
abating, and soon the roaring and crackling
noise of the conflagration and the crash of falling
timbers were more audible than the muttering of
thunder rolling away to the west.</p>

<p>With awe that hushed them into silence, the
Trevors watched for a while the progress of the fire.
Flames burst forth from windows, and blazed up
from roof, till the whole building seemed swathed
in a fiery mantle, from which the wind scattered
myriads of sparks. Fast as rose a column of black
smoke from the conflagration, it was spread by the
gale in a western direction, like a dark pall overshadowing
the snow which lay on the heath. The
Trevors had sought the shelter of a hedge, on the<span class="pagenum">[293]</span>
side opposite to that to which flames and smoke
were driven; and thus not a spark fell beside them,
though they were near enough to the burning dwelling
to feel its glowing heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for you I should now have been <i>there!</i>&rdquo;
exclaimed Bruce, after an interval of silence, as he
pointed towards the house, which every minute was
becoming more like a burning fiery furnace. &ldquo;I
could not have stirred hand or foot; I should have
remained bound, like victim at the stake, waiting
till the flames should reach me. You have saved
me from the most horrible of deaths; I owe my life
to your courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not mine! oh, not mine! it was His gift!&rdquo;
exclaimed Emmie, with a gush of unutterable thankfulness
and joy. &ldquo;Oh! shall I ever again mistrust
the power and the goodness of God!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>A NIGHT-JOURNEY.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The Trevors were not long to remain alone.
The flames from the house, seen far and
wide, soon drew to the spot the inmates
of farms and cottages dotted over the neighbouring
land. Amongst the first arrivals at the scene of the
conflagration was that of Mr. Trevor&rsquo;s own servant,
who was driving the pony-chaise in which he had
returned from S&mdash;&mdash;. Susan, who had found the
paper left by Emmie, and who was alarmed at her
young lady being out in the storm, had despatched
Joe with all speed by the road, after heaping the
chaise with warm wraps to protect Miss Trevor from
the cold. Susan herself had accompanied Joe, in
whose intelligence and promptitude no great trust
was reposed by the old family servant.</p></div>

<p>Very thankful was Emmie for the arrival of the
chaise, which afforded a means of carrying her
brother quickly home; for Bruce was in so exhausted<span class="pagenum">[295]</span>
a state that she feared that he would faint by the
way. The young man let Emmie spread her own
cloak around him, and cushion him up with shawls;
his submission to such offices of kindness was so
unlike Bruce&rsquo;s former self, that Emmie saw in it a
token of prostration of mind as well as of body.
Not a word was uttered by either during the short
drive back to Myst Court. Bruce leaned back with
his eyes closed; his sister scarcely knew whether or
not he were conscious of what was passing around him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare not tell him in his present weak state of
what has happened to Vibert,&rdquo; thought Emmie, whose
mind now recurred to the troubles of her younger
brother, which had been for a while forgotten in the
excitement of the late scenes.</p>

<p>Myst Court was soon reached. Bruce was gently
assisted out of the chaise, which was then at once
sent off to S&mdash;&mdash; to bring a surgeon. Bruce&rsquo;s
wound had never bled much, as it had been inflicted
by a blunt instrument. Susan had offered to bind
it, but the sufferer had refused to let his injured
head be touched save by professional hands. A
ghastly sight the young man presented, as he slowly
entered the hall of Myst Court, leaning on the arm
of his sister; but it was then that he startled Emmie
with the abrupt question, &ldquo;Has Vibert returned
from London?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[296]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; was her faltered reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must go thither at once. When does
the next train start?&mdash;I have lost count of time&mdash;days,
weeks seem to have passed since I was last
here,&rdquo; said Bruce, with an evident effort to collect
his scattered thoughts. He seated himself wearily
on one of the large oak chairs in the hall, and in
his own decided manner repeated the words, &ldquo;When
does the next train start?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bruce, dearest, you are utterly unable to attempt
to take such a journey,&rdquo; said Emmie soothingly.
She feared that her brother&rsquo;s mind was beginning to
wander. Bruce perhaps guessed her suspicion, for
calmly meeting her anxious gaze he reiterated his
question, &ldquo;Only tell me, when does the next train
start for London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not till after dark,&rdquo; replied Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then after dark I go up to London, unless
Vibert return,&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;I must warn him&mdash;I
must give notice to the police&mdash;I must telegraph at
once,&rdquo; and with an effort the young man rose to
his feet. At that moment the superintendent of
police entered the hall, not a little surprised to
see before him, living, the man for whose corpse
he and his companions had been making most diligent
search. The appearance of Bruce showed but
too plainly how narrowly he had escaped the fate<span class="pagenum">[297]</span>
to which he had been supposed to have fallen a
victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought <i>him</i> here?&rdquo; cried Bruce, glancing
at the official, and then turning his inquiring eyes
on his sister.</p>

<p>Concealment was no longer possible; Emmie began
to break gently the evil tidings which had come
that morning from London, but had scarcely uttered
a sentence before Bruce anticipated all that she was
about to tell him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert has been arrested,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the dupe
of the villany of a forger. Emmie, I must go to
the study with this officer; I can give him information
of the greatest importance. He will send
telegraphs to London and to Liverpool, and he and
I will go up to town by the next train. There is a
nefarious plot to be unravelled, and the events of
last night have placed the end of the clue in my
hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His sister saw at once that opposition would be
useless. The more ill Bruce felt himself to be, the
more resolved he was to speak and act while the
power to do so remained. Till he had had his
conference with the superintendent, the sufferer
would take neither rest nor refreshment, save copious
draughts of water, eagerly swallowed to quench
his feverish thirst. Bruce&rsquo;s hand trembled violently<span class="pagenum">[298]</span>
as he replenished the tumbler again and again;
but this was but the weakness of the nerves,&mdash;the
will of the soul was as strong as ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you not suffer us first to bathe and bind
your poor head?&rdquo; suggested Emmie, who could not
look on the injured brow without a thrill of pain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be time for all that,&rdquo; exclaimed
Bruce with impatient gesture; &ldquo;more important
matters press,&mdash;is not our brother&rsquo;s honour at
stake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The condition in which Bruce Trevor appeared,
and the circumstances under which he had been
found, had removed from the mind of the police
official all suspicion that he could ever have been
leagued with the forgers. He had evidently barely
escaped with life from the hands of the ruffians, and
their shallow device for implicating him in their
guilt was transparent to all. The superintendent
eagerly received from Bruce such information regarding
the forgers as was likely to lead to their apprehension
before they should have time to make their
escape from the shores of Britain.</p>

<p>To Emmie, in her anxiety for her brother, the
interview held in the study seemed to be painfully
long; but Bruce had not been half an hour in the
house when a policeman, despatched in haste by the
superintendent, was on his way to S&mdash;&mdash;, commisssioned<span class="pagenum">[299]</span>
to telegraph from thence to Liverpool and to
London.</p>

<p>Then, the immediate strain on his energies being
over, Bruce collapsed for a brief time into a state of
utter prostration. When the surgeon arrived from
S&mdash;&mdash;, he found his patient stretched on the drawing-room
sofa in something between a sleep and a swoon,
with his pale, anxious sister watching beside him.</p>

<p>Emmie remained present while the surgeon performed
his part, giving such trifling aid as she could.
When Dr. Weir had done his work and left the
room, Miss Trevor followed him into the hall, most
anxious to know his opinion as to the extent of the
injury which her brother had sustained from the
blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The wound is not in itself of so <i>very</i> serious a
character,&rdquo; said the surgeon gravely, &ldquo;if the brain
itself have not suffered. But there is a strong tendency
to fever, and the patient should be kept as
quiet and as free from excitement as is possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he actually insists on travelling to London
to-night,&rdquo; cried Emmie; &ldquo;and it is so difficult, so
impossible to resist the will of my brother when he
thinks that a duty must be performed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The surgeon shrugged his shoulders. He, like
every one else at S&mdash;&mdash;, had heard of Vibert&rsquo;s arrest,
and could understand that no light cause drew his<span class="pagenum">[300]</span>
brother towards the metropolis. He had seen already
also something of his patient&rsquo;s decided character, and
recalled to mind the well-known words of one who,
when told that to travel might be to die, replied, &ldquo;It
is not necessary that I should live, but it is necessary
that I should go.&rdquo; Bruce had a few minutes before
in Dr. Weir&rsquo;s presence, expressed a similar sentiment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To oppose him would, I fear, bring on the very
evil which we would guard against,&rdquo; said the surgeon,
after a minute&rsquo;s reflection. &ldquo;I dare not, under
existing circumstances, absolutely forbid the journey
to London.&rdquo; Perhaps Dr. Weir, in giving his reluctant
consent to what he saw that he could not
prevent, was but making a virtue of necessity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will accompany my brother,&rdquo; said Emmie.</p>

<p>As soon as the surgeon had departed, Emmie began
to make preparations for the journey, which
should at least be made to Bruce as comfortable and
as little fatiguing as it was possible for a night-journey
in the depth of winter to be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My young lady is a changed being,&rdquo; thought
Susan, as she found Miss Trevor actively engaged in
packing her brother&rsquo;s carpet-bag. &ldquo;After all the
dreadful news which she heard this morning, after
her exposure to the most fearful of storms, after the
horror of finding her brother half-murdered, and the
narrow escape of both from being burned to death,<span class="pagenum">[301]</span>
I should have expected to have seen my mistress
either in violent hysterics, or in a burning fever!
But here is Miss Trevor able to think of all, arrange
all, care for all, speaking no word of fear, showing
no sign of weakness! I never thought that my
lady could have learned so soon how to &lsquo;glorify
God in the fires!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the arrival of the close vehicle ordered by
Emmie to convey her brother and herself to the
station, the sister made one more earnest attempt to
dissuade Bruce from making an effort which, in his
present state, would probably bring on serious illness.
Was it indeed, she urged, so needful for him
to appear in person in London?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie, I have wronged a brother, and shall I
not do what I can to right him?&rdquo; was Bruce&rsquo;s reply.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;though I knew that to go to
him now were to go indeed to my grave.&rdquo; Emmie
attempted no further remonstrance.</p>

<p>The vehicle came, and the travellers started.
Susan accompanied the Trevors as far as the station,
to take their railway tickets, and look after their
comforts. Emmie would have been thankful to
have taken her faithful attendant with her all the
way to London, but difficulties stood in the way.
Not only had money run short (for Emmie&rsquo;s purse
had been empty, and her brother&rsquo;s had been so<span class="pagenum">[302]</span>
poorly supplied that they had had to borrow from
their servant), but Miss Trevor was afraid further to
encroach on the hospitality of her aunt, whose house
might already be full.</p>

<p>Few persons travelled in winter by the night
train, which was chiefly used for luggage. Bruce
and Emmie had the railway carriage to themselves,
and the invalid was thus able to recline as on a
couch. Very few words passed between the brother
and sister during that long wearisome journey; Bruce
was reserving the small residue of his strength for
the morrow&rsquo;s effort, and as the light of the dull
lamp fell on his almost corpse-like features, Emmie
felt that it would be cruel to disturb him even by a
question. She scarcely knew whether her brother
were thinking or sleeping; but what a full current
of thought was passing through her own mind, as
the train rolled on through the darkness! Emmie
reviewed the events of that&mdash;to her&mdash;most eventful
day with emotions of horror so mixed with fervent
thankfulness, that she could not herself have told
which was the uppermost feeling. Emmie had, as
it were, had lions close to her path, but had found
that the lions were chained; she had looked on
death very near, but her spirit had been so braced
by prayer that she had not fainted at his awful
approach. She had, for once, conquered mistrust,<span class="pagenum">[303]</span>
and by doing so had been the blessed means of
saving the life of her brother. But was she to rest
content with one victory over besetting sin, or could
she suppose that the enemy, though once foiled,
would not perpetually be returning to his too
familiar abode? Had vivid light been thrown into
her heart&rsquo;s haunted chamber, only that she should
again resign it to darkness? Must not the young
Christian be now constantly on the watch, and resolutely
and prayerfully resolve that the thought &ldquo;I
fear&rdquo; should never again turn her feet back from the
path of duty?</p>

<p>Emmie was so absorbed in such reflections that
she almost started when her brother broke silence
at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie, what induced you to go to that house,
and alone?&rdquo; asked Bruce suddenly, opening his
languid eyes, and fixing their gaze on his sister,
who occupied the opposite seat. &ldquo;Had anything
occurred to make you suspect treachery in that most
false of women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question took Emmie by surprise, and she
was about to return a frank reply, when there came
the remembrance of her oath, like the galling of a
hidden chain worn by penitents of old. Even all
that had passed had not set the conscience of the
maiden free from the burden of that dread oath.<span class="pagenum">[304]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell even you, Bruce, why I suspected
Jael,&mdash;why I went through the wood in the storm,&mdash;but
the thing which decided me to make my way
into the house and search there for my brother was
finding one of his slippers close to the garden-gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A faint smile, the first seen on his lips during
that fearful day, passed over the face of Bruce.
&ldquo;Then it was not for nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I
contrived to detach that slipper from my foot as the
villains bore me past the hedge to the gate. It was
so dark that they did not notice the trace I was
leaving behind me. But wherefore can you not tell
me, Emmie, the cause of that suspicion of Jael which
led one so timid as yourself to her dwelling in the
midst of a storm so terrible, that when the bolt struck
the house I thought to have been buried under its
ruins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Bruce, do not ask me!&rdquo; murmured Emmie,
shrinking from the searching gaze of her brother&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Bruce to himself, after a
pause in which he had recalled Emmie&rsquo;s mysterious
disappearance on the night of the eclipse, and her
subsequent agony of terror. &ldquo;You are bound by
some promise,&rdquo; he continued, again addressing his
sister; &ldquo;there had been one moment of weakness,
but how nobly redeemed! Emmie, my preserver,<span class="pagenum">[305]</span>
fear no questions from me; it is enough to know
that you dared danger and death for my sake!&rdquo;
The look of deep grateful affection which accompanied
the words repaid Emmie for all that she had
suffered.</p>

<p>This brief conversation alone broke the silence of
the Trevors ere their arrival in London. The tedious
journey at length was over, the train had reached
the last station. Emmie had never before travelled
without being relieved of all the petty trouble which
a long journey involves; now, on a night in winter,
she had charge of an invalid, and had the care of
all arrangements needed for his comfort. When,
trembling with cold, the travellers stepped out at
last on the platform, it was Emmie&rsquo;s part to see
about luggage and cab, and then to procure at the
refreshment-room wine for her almost fainting companion.
Such matters, indeed, seem to be trifles;
but they formed part of the discipline which was
raising a self-indulgent girl, accustomed to be the
object of constant attention and care, into the
thoughtful and self-forgetting Christian woman.</p>

<p>While the church clocks of the metropolis were
striking the hour of midnight, Emmie and her silent
companion were passing the comparatively deserted
streets on their way to Grosvenor Square. Few
persons were abroad at that hour, especially in the<span class="pagenum">[306]</span>
wider streets of the West-end, save the policeman
on his beat, or the waifs and strays who have no
better home than the casual ward of a workhouse.
The minds of both Bruce and his sister were now
full of the subject of Vibert&rsquo;s arrest, and painful
anxiety to know whether their younger brother were
not at that moment the occupant of some prison-cell.
The Trevors had left Myst Court just before the
arrival of a telegram from their father which would
have relieved their minds from this fear. Vibert
had been taken before a magistrate, but his case had
been remanded till the following day, when, as it
was hoped, news might be received of the arrest of
Colonel Standish. Heavy bail had been offered for
the unhappy youth&rsquo;s reappearance before the court,
and the securities had been accepted. Vibert had
therefore been permitted to accompany his father
back to the house of his aunt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

<small>THE BROTHERS&rsquo; MEETING.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_w.jpg" width="85" height="85" alt="W" class="cap" />
<p class="cap14">With drowsy driver and weary horse, the
cab rolled slowly on, till at length the
rumble of its wheels broke the stillness
of aristocratic Grosvenor Square. Bruce roused himself
as the conveyance stopped at the door of Mrs.
Montalban.</p></div>

<p>As the coming of the Trevors was unexpected,
none of the servants were likely to be up to answer
at once the summons of the bell. No light shone
in the hall, all was shut up; and the driver stood
clapping his arms to keep out the cold, until some
sleepy lackey should rouse himself to obey the unwelcome
summons.</p>

<p>But there was one person in that mansion too
nervous and too much excited to have made any
preparations, even at past midnight, for retiring to
rest. Vibert was pacing up and down his room
when the cab was drawn up at the door; to him<span class="pagenum">[308]</span>
the bell, heard at so late an hour, announced tidings
which must relate to his own unhappy affair. It
was Vibert who, pale with anxiety and distress,
rushed down the six flights of stairs, hurried into
the hall, drew back the massive bolts, unloosed the
chain, and threw open the door, while Mrs. Montalban&rsquo;s
footman was yet rubbing his sleepy eyes and
yawning, before he attempted to ensconce himself in
his livery coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie! Bruce!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished
Vibert, as by the flickering light of the bed-room
candle, which he had brought from his own apartment,
he recognized the travellers who now entered
the hall. &ldquo;For what have you come, and at such a
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To stand by you,&rdquo; answered Bruce, grasping the
hand of his younger brother.</p>

<p>Those brief words&mdash;that grasp of the hand&mdash;were
to the wretched Vibert like the first gleam of
light bursting through clouds of darkness and storm.
Of the bitter drops which had filled the cup of
misery which, since his arrest, Vibert had drained,
perhaps none had been more bitter than the thought
of the contempt which his elder brother would feel
for one who had stood in a police-court, accused
as a felon. Not that Vibert supposed that Bruce
would believe him capable of knowingly passing<span class="pagenum">[309]</span>
forged notes; but what a selfish prodigal&mdash;what a
contemptible dupe&mdash;what a disgrace to the family,
would he not appear in the eyes of his high-minded
elder brother! Bruce, with his lofty sense of duty,&mdash;his
own character so pure from reproach,&mdash;how
he would despise the companion and tool of a
profligate forger! Vibert, notwithstanding his affected
disregard of the opinions of Bruce, really
looked up to him with respect, though that feeling
was largely mixed with that of dislike. The youth
was vain of his own personal advantages; love of
approbation was strong in his soul, and he had
resented the stern Mentor-like superiority assumed
by his elder brother. Now that all Bruce&rsquo;s warnings
against Vibert&rsquo;s folly had been more than
justified by the event, the younger brother winced
at the idea of the stern judgment on his conduct
which would be passed by him who had warned in
vain. The brother&rsquo;s withering sneer&mdash;so thought
Vibert, who was selfish even in his misery&mdash;would
be harder to bear than even his father&rsquo;s deep mortification,
or Emmie&rsquo;s burst of distress. Now to
find sympathy and support, where he had looked for
upbraiding and scorn, touched the heart of the poor
lad, and filled his eyes with tears.</p>

<p>Bruce&rsquo;s dislike to &ldquo;cause any fuss in the house&rdquo;
made him decide at once on accompanying Vibert<span class="pagenum">[310]</span>
back to his room, where, as the younger Trevor
said, there were a sofa and a fire. Emmie was to
steal up softly to the apartment of her cousin
Cecilia, whose habit it was, as she knew, to sit up
reading novels till midnight. There was to be no
noise&mdash;no whispering on the stairs&mdash;to rouse the
family from their slumbers. Vibert wondered at
the earnestness with which Emmie recommended
Bruce to his care; it was strange to the poor lad,
absorbed as he was in his own trouble, that his
sister should appear to be more anxious about Bruce
than unhappy about himself. A feeling of shame
had made Vibert scarcely glance at his brother when
he met him in the hall, and he scarcely noticed with
how feeble and slow a step Bruce now mounted the
long flights of stairs. If Vibert thought at all on
the subject, as, candle in hand, he led the way to
his room, he deemed that his brother was giving to
Emmie, who accompanied Bruce to the upper landing-place,
the support which he was in reality receiving
from the slender arm of his sister.</p>

<p>Bruce entered his brother&rsquo;s room, into which he
had been preceded by Vibert, with difficulty reached
the sofa, and then sank upon it, his brain reeling,
and every object seeming to swim around him. He
threw off the travelling cap which, light as it was,
had sat like a weight of lead on his brow; and<span class="pagenum">[311]</span>
then, indeed, Vibert noticed that his brother&rsquo;s head
was bandaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has happened to you, Bruce?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You look as if you had just walked out
of your grave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce simply replied, &ldquo;I had a blow;&rdquo; and
Vibert&rsquo;s mind went back at once to his own affairs.
The youth, as he stirred the fire to a brighter blaze,
kept up what could scarcely be termed a conversation,
as he himself was the only speaker. Bruce
did not take in the meaning of half the rapidly-uttered
words which fell on his ear,&mdash;to his feverish
brain they were as sounds heard in a dream; but
he was a silent if not an attentive listener, and that
was enough for Vibert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you imagine a more horrid affair than this
has been?&rdquo; exclaimed the younger Trevor. &ldquo;I had
no more doubt that those notes had been issued
from the Bank of England than I had of my own
existence. But I need not tell you that. No one
who knows me could for a moment suspect me of a
dishonourable action, though, as I am ready enough
to own, I have acted with consummate folly. How
could I have let myself be so deceived by a worthless
adventurer? I cannot even now understand
how Standish gained such an influence over my
mind!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[312]</span></p>

<p>Bruce might have replied&mdash;&ldquo;By working on your
vanity and self-love;&rdquo; but the young man had
neither the strength nor the inclination to make
such a remark. Vibert went rambling on with his
painful story; he had been longing for some one to
whom he could pour out his heart, and was agreeably
surprised at not being interrupted by any
caustic remark from his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blow fell upon me in so horridly public a
way!&rdquo; cried Vibert. &ldquo;Just imagine the scene.
There was the large drawing-room full of people,&mdash;my
aunt was giving an afternoon party. We had
the Montagues, Carpenters, stately Sir Richard,&mdash;the
countess and all! The music had struck up;
the couples were placed; I had asked Alice for the
first dance; she and I stood at the top. We were
laughing, chatting, and just beginning to dance.
Suddenly the music stopped,&mdash;musicians, dancers,
every one looking in one direction. A policeman&mdash;astounding
apparition!&mdash;was making his way up
the room! Even then I was not in the least
alarmed. I remember that I turned to Alice, and
jestingly asked her whether she was to be taken up
for stealing hearts! It was no jesting matter for
me! When the fellow in blue laid his grasp on
<i>my</i> arm,&mdash;when he said that his business was with
<i>me</i>,&mdash;I should have liked to have struck him to the<span class="pagenum">[313]</span>
earth; and then&mdash;I should have liked the floor to
have opened beneath me!&rdquo; Vibert, as he spoke,
plunged the poker fiercely into the heart of the fire.
&ldquo;Only conceive,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what it was to
have to walk down that long room, with a policeman&rsquo;s
hand on my collar, and to feel (I dared
not look about me to see) that every eye was
watching my movements! I did indeed catch a
glimpse of my aunt in her purple velvet, with her
face as full of horror as if she had seen the Gorgon&rsquo;s
head! I did hear Alice&rsquo;s exclamation of pity,&mdash;that
was almost the worst of all; for such pity is akin
to contempt! Then my poor uncle, stammering and
confused at the dishonour done to his family and
house, would fain have got me out of the clutch of
the grim policeman; but he could not effect anything
then, though his bail and my father&rsquo;s were
accepted on the following day when I had been
before the magistrate. I was led off from that
grand house&mdash;from that gay throng&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;O
Bruce! can you imagine your brother in the lock-up
for a night! I wonder that I did not go crazy!
And then to have to appear on the next day in a
police-court, on a charge of felony! Horrible!
horrible!&mdash;most horrible! I should wish, when
this affair is over, to shut myself up in a hermitage,
where no one should ever see or hear of me again. I<span class="pagenum">[314]</span>
shall never be able to endure meeting one of those
who beheld me carried off to jail in charge of the
police!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vibert turned suddenly from the fire as he concluded
the sentence, and saw his brother stretched
on the sofa, quite unconscious of his presence, sleeping
the sleep of exhaustion.</p>
<hr class="l1"/>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

<small>CHARGED WITH FELONY.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The remarkable circumstances attending the
arrest of Vibert Trevor, his high connections,
and the official position which his
father had for many years held, made the affair in
which he was implicated cause a very great sensation
in the upper ranks of London society. Never
before had the police-court in which Vibert was for
the second time to appear been so crowded by the
wearers of fashionable bonnets, sable muffs, and
ermine tippets. Never before had so many carriages
(some of them bearing coronets) blocked up the
narrow avenues to the magistrate&rsquo;s court. The
police had some difficulty in clearing a way for
aristocratic ladies through crowds of roughs assembled
to see &ldquo;a gent in the hands of the bobbies!&rdquo;
Expectation was on the tiptoe. To many of
Vibert&rsquo;s gay companions&mdash;the young men with
whom he had played at billiards, the pretty girls<span class="pagenum">[316]</span>
with whom he had danced&mdash;the sight of him standing
at the bar to answer a charge of passing forged
notes, gave a thrill of excitement more delightful
than could have been afforded by the most sensational
novel, or the most charmingly tragical play.</p></div>

<p>Information was circulated amidst the mixed
throng, where news was eagerly passed from mouth
to mouth, that the police at Liverpool had been unsuccessful
in their attempts to discover and arrest
the person who had called himself Colonel Standish.
No person of that name, no one answering to the
description given of his person, had inquired after
the box of jewels at the place to which Vibert was
to have sent it. No individual called Standish had
taken his passage in any vessel about to sail for
America. The police were eagerly on the alert,
but had, it was said, discovered no clue that could
lead to the arrest of the principal criminal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The monkey who used the cat&rsquo;s paw to pull
the chestnuts out of the fire, has got clear off to the
jungle,&rdquo; observed a fashionable-looking young man,
who had been one of Vibert&rsquo;s most particular
friends. &ldquo;Poor Grimalkin is caught with the nuts
in his claws, and will have something to bear in
addition to the pain of the burning!&rdquo; The speaker,
as he ended the remark, raised his gold eye-glass to
his eyes, to enable him to see more distinctly every<span class="pagenum">[317]</span>
nervous twitch on the face of poor Vibert, who,
attended by his father, uncle, and brother, at that
moment approached the bar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! how changed the poor boy looks&mdash;how
shamefaced!&rdquo; whispered Alice to a companion; for
Alice was there in her fashionable hat with its
scarlet feather. &ldquo;To think that I should have
danced and talked nonsense with one who is standing
where all the low thieves and pickpockets stand!&rdquo;
The little lady rose on tiptoe to have a better view
over the shoulders of those in front of her; but had
the grace to hope that the poor prisoner would not
turn his eyes in her direction. There was no danger
of his so doing, the wretched youth could not raise
his eyes from their fixed stare on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert&rsquo;s brother looks more ill than the prisoner
does,&rdquo; observed the companion of Alice; &ldquo;he has a
bandage on his head. One would think that Bruce
had been brought to the bar for prize-fighting, or
for leading the roughs in a row!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! hush! he is going to be sworn as a
witness,&mdash;some one is giving him a glass of cold
water; I wish that I could hand him my scent-bottle,&rdquo;
whispered Alice, who was touched by Bruce&rsquo;s
evident struggle to overcome physical suffering and
mental exhaustion by the force of strong will.</p>

<p>Bruce was sworn as a witness. Very simply and<span class="pagenum">[318]</span>
concisely he gave evidence as to what the reader
knows already. He told of his hearing a noise,
entering the chamber next to his own, seeing the
forgers, and receiving, while struggling with Standish,
a stunning blow from some heavy instrument wielded
by Harper.</p>

<p>Harper&rsquo;s name had not even been mentioned in
the evidence given on the preceding day, Vibert not
being in the slightest degree aware of the strange
old man&rsquo;s complicity in the crime of forging bank-notes.
Bruce&rsquo;s narrative, given in a low but clear
and steady voice, commanded breathless attention.
The silence observed in the crowded court was
scarcely broken even by the rustle of a lady&rsquo;s silk
dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say that you were stunned by the blow
given by this man Harper,&rdquo; observed the magistrate.
&ldquo;Did you long continue in an unconscious state?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not how long I remained senseless,&rdquo; was
the answer of Bruce; &ldquo;probably the cold night air
revived me, for I found, when I came to life, that
the two forgers were bearing me into the wood. I
lay perfectly still, and they doubtless considered me
dead, for the men uttered words to each other which
I was certainly not intended to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you recall to memory any of those words?&rdquo;
the magistrate inquired.<span class="pagenum">[319]</span></p>

<p>Bruce had a tenacious memory, and what had
passed on that eventful night had been as it were
branded on it, never to be erased. He at once
replied to the magistrate&rsquo;s question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first words which I remember hearing were
some spoken by Harper&mdash;&lsquo;How could you trust
Vibert Trevor to pass my notes?&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I trusted him no more than in angling I trust
the fly on my hook,&rsquo; answered Standish. &lsquo;I use him
to make the gudgeons bite; but the fool knows no
more of the nature of the work to which I have put
him than does the senseless fly that covers the barb.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A thrill of satisfaction went through the court.
Mr. Trevor could not restrain a faint exclamation of
thankfulness at this clear testimony to the innocence
of his unfortunate son drawn from Standish himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Proceed, sir, with your evidence,&rdquo; said the
magistrate to Bruce Trevor. The witness went on
with his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How then is the lad to forward the jewels?&rsquo;
asked Harper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is to direct them to me under my assumed
name,&rsquo; replied Standish; &lsquo;but I shall be too wary
to claim the box myself. Aunt Jael, whom no one
suspects, will call at the office for the jewels, and
bring them to us at the White Raven, where we
shall keep close till the <i>Penguin</i> sails.&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[320]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear anything more regarding the
plans of these men?&rdquo; the magistrate asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I had heard enough to put the police
on the right scent on my return to Myst Court,&rdquo;
answered Bruce.</p>

<p>This was all the evidence which young Trevor
could give which bore directly on the charge against
his brother; but so much of interest remained to be
learned, that the examination went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose that this man Harper
and his accomplice intended to do with you, when
they carried you through the wood?&rdquo; asked the
magistrate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They intended to throw my corpse into the pond
on the heath,&rdquo; answered Bruce in the same calm
tone. &ldquo;I knew as much from what they muttered,
though I cannot recall the words; and I reserved
myself for one last desperate struggle for life. As
we left the wood, Harper found out, perhaps by
some involuntary movement that I made, that I
was alive. I was set down under a hedge, and
there followed some conversation between the two
men regarding my fate, of the nature of which I
could guess more than I heard. There was something
said about &lsquo;gallows&rsquo; and &lsquo;hanging for it,&rsquo;
so I concluded that the ruffians thought it a more
serious matter to be tried for murder than for the<span class="pagenum">[321]</span>
forgery of bank-notes. The men lifted me up
again, and carried me into the house of the woman
hitherto called Jael Jessel, whom I now found to be
the wife of the one and the aunt of the other. In
that house I was blindfolded, gagged, and bound
to a table. Half swooning as I was, I knew little
of what was passing around me, save that I judged
from the sounds that I heard that the forgers were
moving their goods and leaving the place. How
many hours I passed alone after their departure I
cannot tell. A great storm came on, and at last a
fire-bolt struck the dwelling, shattering the door,
and setting the place on fire. Then followed the
entrance of my sister, who, alarmed at my absence,
was searching for me, and who found me in the
helpless condition in which the forgers had doubtless
hoped that I would have remained for days undiscovered.
I was scarcely likely to have survived
till the evening, had not timely succour arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Bruce had quite finished giving his
evidence, tidings were brought to the magistrate
from Liverpool, which excited such interest amongst
the crowd thronging the court that an irrepressible
murmur of satisfaction arose. The police, following
the clue given by Bruce Trevor, had arrested at a
low public-house, called the White Raven, three
persons answering to the description given of Harper<span class="pagenum">[322]</span>
and his associates. The woman, it appeared, had
inquired at the coach-office for a box directed to
Colonel Standish, which, it could not be doubted,
was that which was to contain the jewels. Other
suspicious circumstances seemed to place it beyond
question that the individuals now in custody were
Harper, Standish, and Jael. The first named had
been recognized by a policeman as an engraver, who
had been taken up before on a charge of forgery,
but who had been dismissed for want of sufficient
evidence to convict him. Jael, it appeared, was
his wife; and Harper had found in her nephew,
Horace Standish, <i>alias</i> John Stobb, an unscrupulous
accomplice in carrying out his guilty designs. It
afterwards appeared that the Harpers and their
confederate had taken their passages in the <i>Penguin</i>
under three different assumed names.</p>

<p>Vibert still stood as a prisoner at the bar, but he
was not long to remain in so humiliating a position.
The magistrate, who had from the first doubted the
young man&rsquo;s guilt, was now convinced, by Bruce&rsquo;s
testimony, that the prisoner had never been an
accomplice in the crime of the forgers, but in pure
ignorance had passed false notes so skilfully engraved
as almost to defy detection. The magistrate
therefore dismissed the charge against the prisoner,
and Vibert once more was free.<span class="pagenum">[323]</span></p>

<p>A louder hum of approbation, accompanied by
some clapping of hands, followed the order for
Vibert&rsquo;s release. But to Vibert that release brought
no joyful sense of freedom, and the favourable
verdict no feeling of exultation. The youth was
humiliated&mdash;even to the dust. He had only escaped
condemnation as a felon, by being convicted of
acting as a fool. He had been the easy dupe, the
senseless tool of a designing villain. His emblem
was the gaudy fly hiding the hook of the angler!
Under such circumstances the congratulations of the
so-called friends who now pressed around him were
to Vibert but as a stinging insult. His one wish
was to escape all notice, to fly from his fellow-creatures,
and to hide his head where no one should
know of his folly and the disgrace to which it had
brought him. Many hands were held out to the
late prisoner, words were spoken which were meant
to be kind; but Vibert would not notice the hands,
nor listen to the words. He bent down his head
till his long hair almost hid his cheeks, which were
glowing with shame. Vibert pushed his way
through the crowd, scarcely able to draw a full
breath till he had reached the street, rushed into
his uncle&rsquo;s carriage, in which Emmie was anxiously
waiting, and pulled down the blinds to shut himself
out from the sight of mankind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

<small>TREMBLING IN THE BALANCE.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="A" class="cap" />
<p class="cap12">Another and a yet sharper trial was
further to humble and sober the once
gay and thoughtless Vibert. If ever a
gush of warm gratitude had arisen in his heart, it
was drawn forth by the generous effort made in his
behalf by his elder brother. Bruce, when in a state
of exhaustion and suffering which rendered him fit
only for the silence and repose of a sick-chamber,
had taken a long journey in winter, and had then
encountered the fatigue and excitement of giving
evidence in a police-court, acting as one who felt
that he had no leisure to be ill, that it was a time
for action and not for repose. Bruce had been as a
rider forcing his horse to a leap almost beyond its
strength; the brave steed just clearing the stone
wall, and falling on the opposite side, crushing its
rider beneath its weight. An effort had been made,
successfully made; but reaction was certain to follow,<span class="pagenum">[325]</span>
and in the case of Bruce Trevor terrible was
that reaction. Ere nightfall straw was laid down
before one of the houses in Grosvenor Square to
deaden the sound of passing wheels, and the most
skilful physician in London was counting the quick
throbs in the pulse of a patient in a high delirious
fever.</p></div>

<p>Emmie had never before watched by a sick-bed;
she had been far too young at the time of her mother&rsquo;s
last illness to have had anything to do with nursing.
All those who best knew Emmie, with her delicate
nerves and timid character, declared that she was
utterly unfit to nurse in a case that required both
strength and courage; for Bruce&rsquo;s ravings were often
those of a maniac. He had sometimes to be held
down in his bed by main force. But the painful
lessons of the last few days had not been taught to
Emmie in vain. The timid nervous girl had learned
to go to the Fount of Strength, and the firmness
and faith which she thence received astonished her
father and Vibert. When her younger brother would
quit the sick-room, unable to endure the harrowing
sight of Bruce struggling like a demoniac, Emmie
remained at her painful post. The sound of his
sister&rsquo;s voice, the gentle touch of her hand, would
sometimes soothe the poor sufferer when nothing
else had the slightest effect.<span class="pagenum">[326]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you bear to see him thus?&rdquo; exclaimed
Vibert once to his pale but tearless sister, after one
of Bruce&rsquo;s most distressing paroxysms of brain-fever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I try to trust and not be afraid,&rdquo; the poor girl
faintly replied. &ldquo;I try to trust him to God, to my&mdash;his
Heavenly Father. I repeat to myself, <i>God is
love</i>. He can&mdash;oh! He <i>will</i> make all things, even
this most fearful anguish, work together for good to
those who trust Him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But for the ravings of fever, when the mind of
Bruce had lost all power of self-control, never would
mortal but himself have known the extent of the
sufferings which he had endured whilst in the power
of the forgers, and during the hours of torture when
he had remained pinioned and gagged. In the
police-court Bruce had described with calm brevity
the events of that trying night and morning. But
when reason had fled from the sufferer, what images
of horror those events had branded on his mind was
apparent to all who approached him. The dreadful
scenes through which Bruce had passed were, in the
delirium of fever, acted over and over again: now
he was struggling with fearful violence to unloose a
murderer&rsquo;s grasp on his throat, calling for help in
tones so piercing that they thrilled to the hearts of
those watching beside him, and even reached the
ears of passengers in the street. Then the sufferer<span class="pagenum">[327]</span>
seemed to be listening, gasping and trembling as he
listened, to sounds which none but himself could hear.
Bruce would mutter words about the pool&mdash;the deep,
black, icy-cold pool&mdash;and clutch the bed-clothes, as if
to save himself from being dragged down to a watery
grave. At another time the fever-stricken youth
would imagine himself as being again bound in the
house of Jael, would writhe and struggle to free
himself from imaginary cords that cut into his flesh
as he struggled; and anon would convulsively start,
as if again he heard the thunderbolt strike the
dwelling close to his head.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, night after night, in dreadful
transitions from frenzy to stupor, deathlike stupor,
only exchanged for more fearful frenzy, till even
Emmie could scarcely wish for a prolongation of the
terrible struggle. Humbly and submissively she
prayed that if her loved brother were indeed now
passing through the river of death, one ray of reason
might gleam through the awful darkness around
him, and that the waves and billows might indeed
not go over his head.</p>

<p>But Bruce had youth in his favour, and all that
man&rsquo;s skill or woman&rsquo;s tenderness could throw into
the opposite scale to that in which his life appeared
to be gradually sinking. With alternations of hope
and fear, the watchers by the sick-bed marked the<span class="pagenum">[328]</span>
trembling of the balance, scarcely able to believe
that from so fearful an attack of fever the sufferer
ever again could rise. But the crisis came at
last, and the worst was over; the maddening fever
quitted the suffering Bruce, but left him helpless
as an infant, and more nervous than the most weak
and timid of women.</p>

<p>For weeks Bruce could hardly endure the noise of
a step crossing his room; a shadow alarmed him, a
voice would make every nerve in his frame quiver.
The doctor said that for long his patient would be
incapable of any mental exertion; he who had been
so steady and regular in his work, was condemned
to the idleness and inaction which, to a character
like that of Bruce, was in itself a most humiliating
trial and disappointment.</p>

<p>As soon as the invalid could be with safety removed
from London, he was sent to a watering-place
in the south of England. Emmie, whose
health had suffered from her devoted nursing,
accompanied her sick brother. After a while she
exchanged places with Vibert, and rejoined at Myst
Court her father, who was actively fulfilling his
duties as a landlord and benefactor to the poor. In
the latter character Mr. Trevor needed the help of
his daughter, whose health was now sufficiently
restored to enable her to become his able assistant.<span class="pagenum">[329]</span></p>

<p>Vibert had not seen his brother for more than a
month when he joined him at Torquay, and with
the sanguine expectations natural to youth he hoped
that the change of air and scene, and the effect of so
many weeks passed in perfect repose, might have
brought back health and strength to the shattered
frame of Bruce Trevor. The youth was disappointed
to find how slow had been the progress made by
the invalid towards recovery. It was not merely
the hollow eye, the transparent skin, the faint voice
and feeble step that told how far removed convalescence
was from vigorous health, for it seemed to
Vibert as if his brother&rsquo;s firmness of mind, and even
his moral courage, were gone. Bruce so shrank
from any allusions to the sufferings of the past, that
Vibert, who had come full of news which he was
eager to impart, found that he must avoid even
mentioning the names of the Harpers. For some
time Bruce did not hear the result of the trial of the
forgers, who had all been convicted and condemned
to various terms of imprisonment.</p>

<p>But if Bruce&rsquo;s shattered state was distressing both
to himself and to others, it was evident that the
character of the young man was ripening under the
trial. Bruce had been proud in his self-dependence,
impatient of the weakness of others; he had trusted
in the power of his own strong will to overcome all<span class="pagenum">[330]</span>
difficulties before him. He was now, in conscious
infirmity, learning to cast himself simply, humbly,
unreservedly upon the strength of his God. The
proud soul had had to learn that the kingdom of
heaven can only be entered by those who come in
the spirit of a little child, and that the haughtiness
of man must be brought down, that the Lord alone
may be exalted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many things in life that one can&rsquo;t
understand,&rdquo; observed Vibert one day, when he had
just placed a footstool before the brother who had
formerly taunted him with an effeminate love of
luxurious ease. &ldquo;It seems natural enough that I
should have had some rough discipline, seeing what
a thoughtless, selfish life I had been leading, till I
was pulled up sharp by that horrid affair. But you&mdash;the
steadiest fellow in Christendom&mdash;you, who
never broke bounds, or turned to the right or the
left&mdash;I can&rsquo;t see why the heaviest strokes should be
laid upon you, or what good such a long trying
illness can possibly do you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vibert, do you remember what our uncle wrote
on those fragments of paper when we were together
at Summer Villa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vibert nodded an affirmative reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often thought over his words,&rdquo; continued
the invalid; &ldquo;they conveyed a salutary warning,<span class="pagenum">[331]</span>
all the more needed because it raised my anger
against him who had laid his finger upon the tender
spot. Vibert, I, as well as yourself, had my haunted
chamber within the heart, and it has needed the
thunderbolt which has smitten me so low to burst
open a way for the light to enter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few months before nothing could have extorted
from the lips of Bruce Trevor such a confession.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

<small>CHANGES.</small></h2>


<div class="drop">
<img src="images/drop_t.jpg" width="85" height="87" alt="T" class="cap" />
<p class="cap11">The last month of Bruce&rsquo;s stay at Torquay
was passed at the house of a relative;
Vibert had returned to his studies, Emmie&rsquo;s
presence and help were required at home by
her father, and the convalescent no longer needed
constant attendance. It was arranged that Bruce
should remain at the sea-side till his uncle&rsquo;s return
from his voyage, when he and Captain Arrows should
travel to Myst Court together.</p></div>

<p>It is bright sunny noontide in April; earth has
long since cast off her fetters of ice and mantle of
snow, and the voice of the west wind has called
forth innumerable flowers to welcome the spring.
The apple-trees and cherry-trees are full of blossom,
and the meadows are sheeted with gold. If some
clouds flit over the sky, their light shadows but add
the beauty of contrast to sunshine. If soft drops occasionally
fall, they but make the fair earth the fairer.<span class="pagenum">[333]</span></p>

<p>Two travellers have just stepped on the platform
of the station of S&mdash;&mdash;. The pale thoughtful face
of the one is familiar to us as that of Bruce Trevor;
in the healthy, bronzed, intelligent countenance of
the other we recognize that of Captain Arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a hearty welcome to you both!&rdquo; exclaimed
Vibert, who had been awaiting the arrival
of the train with impatience. &ldquo;As the day is so
mild and bright, I have driven over in the pony-chaise
to meet you. I want the captain to have a
good view of the country as we drive to Myst
Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentlemen were soon in the chaise, which
could only conveniently accommodate three; Joe
was to follow with the luggage. The captain and
Vibert sat in front; Bruce preferred occupying the
small seat behind.</p>

<p>Vibert was in the highest spirits, talking and
laughing as he drove. It was well that the pony
knew the way, and required no guiding. The
youth often turned half-round in his seat, to address
himself to his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t this remind you, Bruce, of my first
coming to meet you at this station, when I ran off
with Emmie, and nearly broke both her neck and
my own? What a storm we had then to welcome
us into our home!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[334]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had worse storms since,&rdquo; thought the
silent Bruce Trevor.</p>

<p>Vibert continued his animated conversation with
his uncle, pointing out all the landmarks around,
telling of the improvements made by his father, and
giving lively anecdotes of the people whose dwellings
they passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There now&mdash;yon unsightly square fortress of
brick is the castle of old Bullen, the giant whom
my father, armed with a roll of law-papers, boldly
attacked and subdued. The stream which runs
through our land has ceased to run purple and
crimson; it is now a case of &lsquo;Never say <i>dye</i>.&rsquo; You
see yonder builders busy at work? They have made
good progress with the new cottages, designed on
the most approved plan. Bruce, don&rsquo;t you recollect
the wretched pig-sties of hovels that stood in that
place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce&rsquo;s pale face was lighted up with interest and
pleasure; the plans for the cottages had been made
by himself, soon after his arrival in Wiltshire. That
these plans were actually being carried out, had
been purposely kept a secret from him, in order to
give him a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yon field seems to be divided into allotments,&rdquo;
observed Captain Arrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s one of the schemes of my father for<span class="pagenum">[335]</span>
improving the state of his peasants; he says that
he had the notion from Bruce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how does Emmie like her new life?&rdquo; asked
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Emmie! why, she&rsquo;s a changed being&mdash;changed
from the pale, clinging jessamine, into a bright
apple-blossom!&rdquo; cried Vibert. &ldquo;Emmie is busy
from morning till night; she drills her awkward
squad of pinafored children in the barn, till a proper
school can be built, and has actually coaxed them
into washing their faces! She has a book like a
parish register, with all the tenants&rsquo; names put
down, age, number of children, and all that sort of
dry information; which seems, however, to interest
her. Emmie ventures to enter the dirtiest cottage;
but, somehow or other, soap and water are more
freely used now than when she first came to the
place. Emmie is a kind of guardian, or rather
guardian-angel, to the poor. Why, she has even
tackled an old ploughman, who was notoriously
fond of his glass; and if he gives up gin and whisky,
it will be all owing to the influence of the young
lady. You will be as much surprised at the change
in Emmie, as my father was yesterday, when old
Blair told him that I was a steady, promising young
man!&rdquo; Vibert leaned back in his seat, and laughed
so merrily, that had not the pony at least been<span class="pagenum">[336]</span>
steady, the accident of the first evening might have
been repeated, by the chaise being upset into a
ditch.</p>

<p>Bruce neither shared the merriment nor joined
in the conversation. Though young Trevor&rsquo;s health
had by this time been greatly restored, his shattered
nerves had not completely regained their tone.
Bruce regarded Myst Court with extreme aversion,
from the painful associations connected in his mind
with the place, and would have been most glad had
his father sold the estate at once. No one knew
the shrinking dislike, almost amounting to loathing,
with which Bruce thought of reoccupying the room
next to that hateful bricked-up chamber in which
he had suffered so much. The young man knew
that other rooms in Myst Court had by this time been
repaired and furnished, and twice had he taken up
his pen to write a request that his apartment might
be exchanged for another, and twice he had thrown
down the pen, ashamed to betray such childish
weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I scorned, even in poor Emmie, what I deemed
silly superstition,&rdquo; thought Bruce. &ldquo;There is nothing
that teaches one to feel for the infirmities of
others like suffering, as I now do, from one&rsquo;s own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce&rsquo;s aversion to the room adjoining the haunted
chamber arose, it need scarcely be said, from a different<span class="pagenum">[337]</span>
cause from that which had made his sister
dread to occupy the apartment. There was neither
superstition nor mistrust in the mind of Bruce; he
had no fear of apparitions; but he did shrink from
reviving the images of horror impressed on memory,
which, during his illness, had excited his brain to
the point of frenzy. No one knew of the mental
struggle in the mind of the convalescent; not to his
nearest and dearest friend would he confide a weakness
for which he despised himself. Bruce&rsquo;s post
of duty was at Myst Court, and he deemed it a matter
of comparatively small importance whether he
disliked that post or not. Young Trevor&rsquo;s habitual
self-control was now exercised in overcoming the
infirmity left by long illness; and while Bruce was
accusing himself of being a despicable coward, he
had at no period of his life exercised more that
courage which</p>

<div class="pcenter"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&ldquo;Triumphs over fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nobly dares the danger nature shrinks from.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Mr. Trevor and his daughter met the travellers
at the iron gate which has been repeatedly mentioned
as opening into the grounds of Myst Court.
Emmie&rsquo;s face, radiant with smiles of welcome, and
blooming with happiness and health, did indeed
rival the soft beauty of the apple-blossom. Captain
Arrows and his nephews quitted the chaise; and<span class="pagenum">[338]</span>
while Vibert on foot led the pony, the whole party
sauntered at an easy pace along the carriage-drive,
Emmie keeping close to the side of her newly-restored
brother. With what tender, thankful joy
she looked upon him whose step, but for her self-conquest,
would never have trod that path again!</p>

<p>The trees on either side of the road were opening
their budding leaves to the sunshine; the woods
were full of the song of birds; and amidst the
copse clusters of violets, primroses, and wood anemones,
enamelled with their varied tints the carpet
of moss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see Myst Court in its beauty,&rdquo; said Vibert
to his uncle, as a turn in the road brought the
party in view of the stately mansion. &ldquo;My first
sight of the haunted house was on a stormy night
in November, when poor Emmie and I arrived
dripping and half-drowned, and Bruce welcomed us
home with a scowl and a growl.&mdash;Now, Bruce, does
not the garden do credit to Emmie? Look at the
flowers in those classically-shaped vases, and the beds
all ablaze with crocuses, purple, golden, and white!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The garden is greatly improved,&rdquo; said Bruce,
forcing himself to speak in a cheerful tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what will you say to the interior of the
house? it is there that most has been done,&rdquo; cried
Vibert. &ldquo;Emmie has now her own boudoir, and I<span class="pagenum">[339]</span>
think that you will own that it is a gem! I&rsquo;ve
done much of the ornamenting part myself, and am
not a little proud of my taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vibert was so impatient to show the boudoir that,
after the party had entered the hall, he insisted
with boyish vehemence upon their at once proceeding
up the broad oaken staircase, which on their
first coming had led only to the sleeping apartments
and the corridor upon which they had opened.
Vibert, leading the way, drew back the heavy tapestry
curtain, beyond which lay the two rooms
which have so often been mentioned. The first
apartment was that which Bruce had occupied, and
which he was to occupy still; but it was not here
that Vibert stopped. A little beyond it was an
open door, and through the doorway the eager
youth led the party into a fairy-like apartment,
where sunshine streamed through the diamond-shaped
panes of a mullioned window, while shining
mirrors reflected graceful ornaments within, and
pictures wreathed with garlands of spring wild-flowers,
or imaged on their clear surfaces the beauty
of the woodland without.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call this Emmie&rsquo;s boudoir; but she insists
that it shall be your study, Bruce,&rdquo; cried Vibert.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty fairy-like retreat for you to read or
for her to sing in.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[340]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely this must be&mdash;<i>the haunted chamber!</i>&rdquo;
exclaimed the astonished Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The disenchanted chamber, without its gloom
or its spectres,&rdquo; observed the smiling Emmie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there was a codicil to the old lady&rsquo;s will
which obliged us to keep this room bricked up,&rdquo;
observed Bruce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That codicil was a forgery,&rdquo; interrupted Mr.
Trevor. &ldquo;Harper, as unprincipled in devising
schemes of fraud as he was skilful in carrying them
out, had in this forged codicil attempted to achieve
a double purpose. He made over to his wife a
house and property to which she had no real claim,
and he for a while contrived to secure to himself
what was called the haunted chamber. Here were
left his graving tools, his printing-press, and whatever
else was required for his nefarious work; and
here he pursued his occupation, shielded from interruption
by the superstitious fears which his wife
took pains to instil. The guilty man, with his
associates, now reaps the reward of his crimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bruce looked around him with admiring wonder.
It was impossible to recognize the place, which he
had only once seen before, when fire and lamp-light
threw a red glare on instruments of guilt, and the
threatening countenances of ruffians disturbed at
their unhallowed work. Turning towards his sister<span class="pagenum">[341]</span>
with a brightening countenance, young Trevor exclaimed,
&ldquo;What a change is made by admitting the
pure light of heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it is with these words, taken in a loftier
sense, that I would now close my story. Its object
has been to lead the reader to search the haunted
chamber of his own heart, to discover there the
lurking ministers of evil who may, unknown even
to himself, have made it their secret abode. Let
us resolutely and prayerfully resolve, at whatever
cost of humiliation or shame, to know ourselves, to
recognize and face the sin that so easily besets us.
Let the brickwork of ignorance be thrown down,
and let not spiritual sunshine be shut out from the
self-deceived heart. <i>Pride</i>, <i>Self-love</i>, cowardly <i>Mistrust</i>
of God&rsquo;s wisdom and goodness, are natural to
our fallen nature; but the entrance of His Word
into the heart is as that of the glorious beams of
the day,&mdash;joy, brightness, and holiness follow the
admission into its deepest recesses of the pure, life-giving
light of Heaven!</p>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
